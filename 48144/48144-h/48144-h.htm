<p class='c014'>The loud-speaker’s bellow died away and there was
an answering stir in the big terminal building of the airport.
People began to move toward the wide windows
that overlooked the landing field. Soon there was a thick
wall of humanity packed against the rail that protected
the glass.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Too jammed up here. Let’s go outside.” The young
man who spoke was slender and slightly more than
medium height. Over a neat gray flannel suit he wore a
tan trench coat which hung well from broad shoulders.
His black hair looked even blacker than usual in the
brilliant glare of the well-lighted room.</p>

<p class='c015'>His companion towered over him by almost half a
foot. A trench coat, also tan, dropped from massive
shoulders that hinted of tremendous power. He lifted his
left hand to look at his wrist watch. “On time,” he said.
Then, using his shoulders as a wedge, he gently forced
a path to the doors. His flaming red hair stood out above
the crowd like a beacon.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>Outside, in the crisp December afternoon, the air
was filled with the heavy throb of plane motors. Overhead,
a silver ship was wheeling into the wind, landing
gear down.</p>

<p class='c015'>The loud-speaker came to life again. “Flight two-oh-six,
from Paris,” it intoned, “now landing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy Allen, the huge redhead, touched his friend’s
arm. “Feels good to have him coming home for Christmas,
huh?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken Holt grinned briefly, his eyes steadily riveted on
the plane now zooming toward them down the paved
strip. “And how!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If I had any sense,” Sandy said, “I’d fade out on an
occasion like this. It isn’t often that you and your
father—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you had any sense,” Ken interrupted, “you’d remember
that if it weren’t for the oversized Allen clan I
might not even—”</p>

<p class='c015'>The deafening roar of engines cut off the rest of his
sentence, but Sandy’s face had already begun to redden.
He could take almost anything except gratitude, and
he hated to be reminded of the circumstances in which
he and Ken had first met. Ken’s father had been in desperate
danger then, and the entire Allen family—Pop,
Bert, Sandy, and Mom—had taken part in the frightening
hours of action that followed their meeting.</p>

<p class='c015'>Afterward, Ken Holt, motherless for years, had left
his boarding school at the Allens’ insistence to make his
home with them. Mom Allen treated him like another
son, and Pop Allen had given Ken a part in the operation
of the Allen-owned newspaper, the Brentwood
<i>Advance</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>Ken and Sandy had shared many adventures since
then; had encountered many exciting and dangerous
puzzles which they had solved together. They worked
as a team, both in unraveling mysteries and in reporting
them afterward. Ken’s stories and Sandy’s photographs
had been eagerly accepted not only by the
<i>Advance</i>, but also by Global News, the gigantic news-gathering
agency for which Ken’s father, Richard Holt,
worked.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken glanced up at Sandy’s flushed face. “Relax,
chum,” he said. “I won’t say another word about how
much I owe—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy clamped his huge hand over Ken’s mouth. “I’ll
say you won’t.” He grinned. “In return for your silence—something
we rarely get from you,” he went on, “I’ll
let you in on a secret.” He removed his hand and
reached into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What secret?” Ken asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You remember that last little mess we got into—the
one Pop called <i>The Secret of Hangman’s Inn</i>?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d just as soon not remember that,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have it your own way.” Sandy had pulled a piece of
paper out of his pocket. “In that case you won’t want
your half of this check from Global for the yarn and the
pictures we sent them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken grabbed for the check and looked at it. “What
do you know!” he murmured. “A hundred and fifty
dollars! Granger must be getting soft in the head.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Granger,” Sandy said loftily, “is a top-flight news
editor. He appreciates the remarkable quality of my
pictures. He’d probably make it two hundred if he
didn’t have to wade through that stuff you call writing.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>Ken handed the check back to Sandy. “Pictures,” he
said, “are something anybody can take. But writing—real
writing—” Suddenly he broke off. “There’s Dad!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Richard Holt had just stepped out of the plane, first
in the line of passengers descending the stairway. He
was a slender figure in a rumpled topcoat, with a brief
case clamped under one arm. The other arm raised in
a swift salute as he spotted them.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hi!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dad!” Ken’s answering shout carried far across the
field. His father spent most of his time in distant quarters
of the globe, ferreting out the stories that had made
him famous. His visits home, brief and infrequent,
were always exciting. The Allens enjoyed them as much
as Ken himself did, and this year they were all particularly
pleased at the thought of having Richard Holt
at hand over the holidays.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ll meet you outside the customs office,” Ken
called, as his father drew nearer.</p>

<p class='c015'>Richard Holt nodded, smiling.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come on!” Ken said to Sandy, and they turned back
through the crowd. “It won’t take him long to clear
customs. They know him by now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Twenty minutes later Richard Holt came through the
barrier to where they were waiting for him. He dropped
two bags and his brief case and threw an arm around
each of the boys. Then he stood back a pace to look
them over.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you two as good as you look?” he demanded,
grinning widely.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’re even better,” Sandy assured him, scooping
up both the bags. “You look O.K. too.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You look great, Dad,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>“I am. And glad to be home too.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is our first Christmas together in three years.”
Ken groped for the brief case, but his eyes never left
his father’s face.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ll make it a good one, son.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy began to lead the way to the parking lot. “If
food will help,” he said, “I think you can count on Mom.
Wait until you see the turkey she’s got!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“With cranberry sauce?” Richard Holt asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy nodded. “Also with dressing, sweet potatoes,
plum pudding—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stop!” Ken’s father commanded. “Let us waste no
more time talking. On to Brentwood! That is,” he corrected
himself, as he came to a halt beside the boys’
red convertible, “on to Brentwood after a quick stop
at my apartment. I want to get rid of some of this luggage
and change my clothes. I’ll sit in the back seat with
the bags, if you don’t mind,” he went on, “so I can be
sorting out the things I want to take with me. It’ll save
time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy started the motor and the car slid smoothly
into the line of traffic heading for New York City.
Forty-five minutes later he pulled to a stop before the
building in which Ken’s father maintained his seldom-used
apartment.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Give me five minutes,” Richard Holt said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Shall I carry your bags up, Dad?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve got them.” The correspondent swung one in
each hand. “They’re considerably lighter than they
were.” He nodded toward a heap of packages on the
back seat. “Don’t go snooping in those things while I’m
gone.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>“Word of honor,” Ken said, grinning.</p>

<p class='c015'>Richard Holt was back at the car again in six minutes
flat. “O.K., men,” he said, sliding into the front seat beside
Ken. “Head for Brentwood—and don’t spare the
horsepower.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Aye, aye, sir.” Sandy let the car move forward. A
moment later he was heading southward toward the
Holland Tunnel and New Jersey across the Hudson
River.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now,” Mr. Holt said, settling himself comfortably,
“you can begin to tell me what Mom’s preparing
for tonight. After all, the Christmas turkey is still two
days away. She doesn’t expect me to fast until then, I
hope.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not quite,” Sandy assured him. “For tonight she’s
got—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Several hours later Richard Holt shoved his chair
back from the Allen dinner table and sighed luxuriously.
“Sandy didn’t exaggerate a bit,” he assured Mom Allen.
“My only worry now is recovering my appetite in time
for the turkey.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mom’s eyes twinkled at him. “One good way of working
off a meal is to wash the dishes, Richard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now, Mom,” Pop protested. “Dick’s a guest.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I always think of him as a member of the family,”
Mom said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thank you, Mom,” Richard Holt said. “It’s an honor—even
if it does make me eligible for dishwashing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mom stood up. “Then that’s settled. I’ll just leave
everything in your capable masculine hands, while I
run down the street to visit with my sister for a while.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>Bert grinned. “That’s where Mom’s hoarding her
presents,” he explained to Richard Holt. “She doesn’t
trust us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have my reasons,” Mom assured him as she departed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy washed, Ken dried, and Bert stacked the dishes
in their places in the cupboard. Pop and Ken’s father
stood on the side lines to give what Pop called their
“invaluable advice.” Within half an hour the job was
done.</p>

<p class='c015'>As Ken flipped his dish towel over the rack, he said,
“Do you want some paper and ribbon and stuff for
wrapping up those packages you brought, Dad? We’ve
got plenty.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Fine,” his father said. “I was just thinking they didn’t
look very festive in the old newspapers I’ve got wadded
around them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Pop took his pipe out of his mouth. “You know, Dick,
we Allens follow the custom of opening presents on
Christmas Eve. Hope this isn’t opposed to your own
tradition.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It suits me fine.” Mr. Holt smiled. “Means we can
sleep later on Christmas morning—and work up more
strength for the turkey.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken brought out the cardboard box of wrappings he
had found in a closet. “Want me to bring the packages
down from your room, Dad?” he asked, with a great
show of innocence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not on your life,” his father told him. “You can just
wait until tomorrow night to see what’s in them.” He
started for the stairs himself.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll give you a hand,” Bert offered, when Richard
Holt had returned with the packages.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>“Don’t let him,” Sandy advised. “It’s a trick. He just
wants to poke around.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The foreign correspondent grinned. “I need help, all
right. I’m no good at this.” He picked up the largest of
the various bundles. “But this one is yours, Bert, so
don’t touch it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll wrap that one,” Pop offered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thanks.” Mr. Holt hefted two parcels of almost
equal size, and finally handed one to Sandy. “That’s
Pop’s—and don’t drop it.” He handed the other to Bert.
“That’s Sandy’s—and that had better not be dropped
either.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken eyed the two packages still on the table. “Which
is Mom’s? I’ll do hers.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let that wait for last,” his father said. “I want a
conference on it. In the meantime—” He took up the
smaller of the two remaining parcels and set to work
on it himself.</p>

<p class='c015'>When they were all finished, Richard Holt began to
tear the heavy newspaper wrapping from the final
parcel. “Take a look at this, will you?” he asked. “If you
don’t think Mom will like it, I’ll get her something else
tomorrow. I don’t feel very satisfied with it myself.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The last sheet of paper fell away to disclose a small
iron box, about eight inches long, four inches wide, and
four inches deep. The surface was heavily ornamented
with scrollwork, and its considerable weight was evident
from the way Ken’s father held it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I thought,” he said half-apologetically, “that she
could line it with velvet or something and use it for a
jewel box. But I don’t know much about such things.
Maybe you can suggest something else she’d rather
have.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>“She’ll love it,” Pop said decisively. “She loves old
things—antiques. And this sure looks old.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think it’s old enough,” Richard Holt said. “Several
hundred years, I’d guess. It was probably made originally
to be used as a sort of home safe-deposit box.”
His finger pressed one of the curlicues on the front of
the box and the lid sprang open.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hey!” Sandy exclaimed admiringly. “A secret
catch!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“May I try it?” Bert asked. “Beautiful workmanship,”
he muttered, as his fingers explored the front. Finally
he found the proper curlicue and again the lid flew
open.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy tried it next, and then Pop and then Ken.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No doubt about it,” Sandy said finally. “Mom’ll be
crazy about it. She likes secrets as much as she likes
antiques.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken, about to hand the box back to his father, saw
that Richard Holt’s hands were occupied with lighting
a cigarette. So he put the box, instead, on the platform
of Mrs. Allen’s kitchen scale, near at hand on the shelf.
The indicator of the scale swung sharply over.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look,” Sandy said. “Four and a half pounds even.
It weighs a lot for such a little thing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They didn’t skimp on materials in those days,” Pop
said. “Where’d you get hold of it, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“One of the porters in the Global office in Rome
asked me if I wanted to buy it,” the foreign correspondent
answered. “I knew he’d been selling some of his
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>family heirlooms—he has a hard time getting along—and
I wanted to help him out. I persuaded myself at
the time that it would do for Mom’s present, but later
I had some qualms about it. I thought maybe I should
have shopped around, instead of just taking something
that fell into my hands. But if you think it’s all right—”</p>

<p class='c015'>He cleared a space on the kitchen table, spread out
a sheet of wrapping paper, and reached for the box.
As he picked it up, it slipped from his fingers, struck
the edge of the cupboard a glancing blow, and crashed
to the floor. The lid sprang open.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy and Ken both dived for it as Richard Holt
muttered, “That was stupid of me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It can’t be hurt,” Pop said. “It’s made too solidly.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Holt pressed the lid into place, but when he took
his hand away it opened again. He tried a second time.
Once more the lid refused to stay closed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Five heads bent over to study the tiny mechanism.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bert touched the little spring catch. “That’s what’s
wrong,” he said. “The little lever is bent out of shape.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Maybe I can fix it,” Sandy offered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Better not try,” Pop cautioned. “An expensive antique
like that—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It wasn’t expensive, I assure you,” Richard Holt
said. “It—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Never mind,” Pop said. “It’s an antique and I don’t
think anybody but Sam Morris ought to touch it. He’s
the best jeweler in town. He can fix anything.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy offered to telephone Morris to see if he could
take care of the job that evening. When he returned
from the hall he reported that the jeweler was just then
closing his shop, but that he had promised to repair the
box the next day despite the rush of orders that always
claimed his attention on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>“So let’s just get it out of sight before Mom comes
home,” Pop said. “Then you boys can take it down to
him first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How’s this?” Bert asked, dumping an assortment of
Christmas seals out of a shoe box. “You can put it in
here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>When the little box was inside, he snapped a rubber
band around the cardboard container and scrawled on
the cover “Mom—Don’t peek!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And we’ll leave it right here,” Bert said, placing it
in full sight on the sideboard.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What’s the idea?” Richard Holt wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c015'>Pop grinned. “Just teasing her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’ll try to wheedle a hint out of us—without ever
asking a direct question,” Bert said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But she won’t look inside,” Sandy added.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sounds like some form of torture to me,” Ken’s
father said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is,” Sandy admitted, grinning. “But it’s an old
Allen custom—only usually we’re on the receiving end.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But Mom, when she returned a little later, refused
to give them the satisfaction of a single question. She
did walk past the sideboard several times, but they
could never catch her looking directly at the box. And
once, when she had to move it aside to make room
for her morning’s setting of rolls, she seemed not
even to notice that the shoe box was a stranger in her
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c015'>Richard Holt grinned at the Allens, and they grinned
sheepishly back at him. “If there’s any teasing going
on around here,” he said quietly, “I don’t think we’re
doing it.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>“Did I hear you say you wanted a cheese sandwich?”
Mom said. Her eyes were twinkling.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Eh—why, yes, I believe I could manage one—even
after all that dinner,” Richard Holt admitted.</p>

<p class='c015'>Some time later, as Sandy crawled into bed and
snapped of the light at his elbow, he murmured his
usual last request to Ken. “Don’t forget to open the
window.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken slid the frame up several inches and shivered as
the cold air struck him. “It’s snowing,” he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was no answer. Sandy was already asleep.</p>

<p class='c015'>But Ken was still wide awake ten minutes later. He
turned over and tried counting sheep, but the ruse
didn’t work.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Serves me right,” he muttered, “for eating that
cheese sandwich.” He turned over once more.</p>

<p class='c015'>When another ten minutes had gone by he slid out
from under the covers.</p>

<p class='c015'>“A good dull book—that’s what I need,” Ken decided.
“And Pop’s got plenty of them in his library
downstairs.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In his robe and slippers he cautiously opened the
bedroom door and stepped out into the silent hallway.
As he moved toward the stairway he slid one hand
along the wall to feel for the hall-light switch.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly he stopped. A cold draft was swirling
around his feet. He was just deciding that he hadn’t
pulled the bedroom door tight shut when something
else caught his attention. Below him, in the darkness,
a faint click sounded.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>And almost immediately the draft around his feet
died away.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s hand moved swiftly then. His fingers found
the switch and the hall light snapped on. Ken took the
two descending steps to the turn in a single quiet leap.
But before he could start down the rest of the flight he
heard another click from downstairs, and felt another
surge of cold air around his feet. A third mysterious
click sounded just as he reached the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken snapped on all three switches on the wall of the
lower hallway. The hallway itself, the living room, and
the sun porch all became brightly illuminated.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the light revealed nothing to his searching eyes.
The rooms looked just as they had looked some time before,
when the Allens and Holts had gone upstairs to
bed. He went through the dining room, into the kitchen,
and into the pantry, turning on all the lights as he went.
But nowhere was there any sign of disturbance, or of
an intruder who might have been responsible for those
clicking sounds.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken shook his head. “Was I dreaming? I certainly
thought I heard something down here. And it sounded
like the front door opening and closing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Finally he turned off all the lights, picked up his book,
and started back toward the stairs. But at the foot of
them he stopped. That cold draft around his feet
couldn’t have been a dream.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken moved swiftly to the front door. It was securely
locked. He started for the kitchen door and then turned
back.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>He snapped on the front entrance light and pulled
the curtain away from the glass panel in the door in
order to peer out.</p>

<p class='c015'>His breath caught sharply. Footprints stood out
clearly on the snow-covered porch. And through the
veil of falling snow, for as far as the light penetrated,
he could see further footprints—on the porch steps and
on the flagstone walk that crossed the lawn to the sidewalk.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

  <h2 id='chap02' class='c011'>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>A FIRE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There was a double line of the footprints—one set
coming toward the door, one set going away from it.
Ken stared at them for a long moment.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly he realized that he was clearly visible,
through the glass, to anyone who might be outside the
house. Quickly he dropped the curtain into place and
with a swift gesture he fastened the safety chain above
the lock on the door.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then he ran to the back door and fastened the safety
chain there.</p>

<p class='c015'>The events of the past few moments were perfectly
clear in his mind. He sat on the edge of the kitchen
table and ran over them again, trying to explain them
to himself as he went along.</p>

<p class='c015'>He had stepped out of his bedroom and had almost
immediately felt the draft of cold air. Probably the front
door was just then being opened. The faint click he had
heard an instant later had probably been the door being
cased shut again—because after the click he had no
longer felt the draft.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>The intruder—and there must have been one, Ken
concluded—had actually been inside the house. Because
there had been two other clicks, and another draft of
cold air, which must have occurred as the intruder
opened the closed door again in order to escape into the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was out of the kitchen in a flash, and on his knees
before the front door. His fingers explored the surface
of the polished floor. A few feet inside the threshold
there were two patches of dampness.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken moved backward carefully, surveying every inch
of the smooth surface. He found no further wet spots.
It seemed clear that the intruder had taken one step
into the hall and then retreated again, apparently
frightened off by Ken’s own footsteps in the upper hall.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken made one more round of the house, and again
assured himself that nothing had been taken or disturbed.
His impulse to wake Sandy, and tell him about
the whole business, died slowly away. There seemed
no point in arousing Sandy, or anybody else, in the middle
of the night.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken warmed a glass of milk for himself in the kitchen
and drank it thoughtfully. Then he went back upstairs,
with a book under his arm. But he didn’t turn on his
small reading light. He lay on his back, staring up into
the darkness and puzzling over the mysterious intruder,
until he finally fell into a troubled sleep.</p>

<p class='c015'>When he woke up, the clock said only seven-thirty,
but he got out of bed immediately. The snow had
stopped. The world outside was blanketed with white.
It was dazzling to Ken’s eyes, even at that early hour
of a winter morning.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>Sandy opened one sleepy eye as Ken stripped off his
pajamas and began to dress. “Where do you think you’re
going at this time of night?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Downstairs,” Ken said. “And it’s morning. You’d better
get up too. I’ve got something to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy closed his eye again. “Can’t you tell me here?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’d wake everybody else up.” Ken tied his last
shoelace. “Come on. It’s important.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The seriousness in his voice brought Sandy to a sitting
position. “O.K. Get some coffee going. I’ll be down before
it’s ready.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ten minutes later, while the coffee percolator bubbled
away unnoticed, Ken completed his story.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” he said after a moment, “what do you think?
Were we almost burglarized—or weren’t we?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy set his empty orange-juice glass on the table.
He was grinning widely. “I think,” he said, “you were
asleep last night half a minute after I was. The whole
thing was a dream. You should give up cheese sandwiches.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken pointed to the rear door. “I didn’t dream the
chain into place there. Or on the front door, either.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy shrugged. “Maybe you walked in your sleep.”
But he got to his feet. “All right. Let’s go see these
alleged footsteps on the front porch.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They walked through the hall together. Sandy unfastened
the chain, unlocked the door, and threw it
wide open. The white sweep of snow over the porch
was unmarked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I could have told you they wouldn’t show any more,”
Ken pointed out. “It was still snowing then. Naturally
they got covered up.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>Sandy was still smiling as he bent down to examine
the outer face of the lock. When he straightened again
he looked sober.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Take a look,” he said quietly. “Those little scratches
on the face plate were never made by keys. I’d say
somebody’s been using a picklock in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d say it’s a good thing I <i>did</i> eat cheese sandwiches,”
Ken said a moment later, as they closed the door. “If I
hadn’t come downstairs the house might have been
cleaned out. Do you think we ought to notify the
police?” he asked, when they were back in the kitchen
and Sandy was pouring out two cups of coffee.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let’s let Pop decide,” Sandy suggested. “And let’s
not worry Mom about it as long as nothing was taken
and no harm seems to have been done.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Right,” Ken agreed. “We can talk to Pop at the
office.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They ate some toast, drank their coffee, and then went
outside to clear the walks and the driveway. By the time
they had finished shoveling the snow it was almost nine
o’clock and they were ready for some of the bacon and
eggs Mom was preparing for Pop and Bert and Richard
Holt and herself.</p>

<p class='c015'>The phone rang while they were all at the table.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bert went to answer it. “Global News wants Richard
Holt,” he called from the hall.</p>

<p class='c015'>Holt shoved his chair back with an impatient gesture.
“I called the office from the apartment yesterday, just
to let them know I was back,” he said. “I see now that
was a mistake. If they’ve thought up an assignment that
will cut me out of a turkey dinner—” He disappeared
into the hall.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>When he came back he was smiling. “Nothing serious,”
he reported quickly, answering the question in
Ken’s eyes. “I’m still on vacation. Global just wanted to
let me know I didn’t close the apartment door carefully
when I dashed in and out yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Global told you that?” Pop looked blank.</p>

<p class='c015'>The correspondent grinned over a fresh cup of coffee.
“I know it sounds confusing. Seems the apartment-house
janitor found my door ajar when he was cleaning the
hall this morning. He didn’t know I was back in the
country, so he called Global News to ask what to do
about it. Granger sent a man down to look the place
over—very kind of him, of course, as he was careful to
remind me. But nothing was disturbed—clothes, portable
radio, typewriter, all safe and sound. No signs of
illegal entry, so apparently the fault was mine.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He grinned again. “Granger wouldn’t even have
called me about it, except that it gave him a chance to
explain that Global always has the best interests of their
employees at heart.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The others grinned back at him, all but Ken and
Sandy who looked soberly at each other over the table.
The same thought was in both their minds. An attempted
burglary in Brentwood and a mysteriously unlocked
door in Holt’s New York apartment, both on the
same night, seemed a remarkable coincidence. Sandy
opened his mouth to speak.</p>

<p class='c015'>But Ken, shaking his head slightly, got to his feet.
“Are we all vacationing today?” he asked. “Or are we
going down to the office?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hope you’re not all planning to vacation under my
feet,” Mom said frankly. “I’ve got a lot to do today.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>“We can take a hint,” Pop replied with dignity.
“Come on, Holt. There’s not much work on tap for today,
but we can yarn at the office as comfortably as we can
here. You two,” he added to Sandy and Ken, “have to
take you-know-what to you-know-where.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hope you’re referring to that disreputable-looking
shoe box on the sideboard,” Mom said. “I’d like to have
somebody take it somewhere out of my way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Know what’s in it, Mom?” Bert asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No. And I haven’t the slightest curiosity,” Mom told
her older son.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not much, you haven’t!” Bert said. “I’ll bet you
spent half an hour this morning trying to see through
the cardboard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have other things to do with my time, especially
on a busy day like this,” Mom assured him. “For example,
there are the dishes to be done. But of course
if you’re all going to be here, you might—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Pop was on his feet. “We’re on our way, ma’am. On
our way. Come on, Holt, you drive down with Bert and
me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken and Sandy took the shoe box with them when
they left a few minutes later, but they didn’t go directly
to Sam Morris’s shop. They went to the office first.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We think you ought to know about something that
happened last night, Pop,” Sandy said abruptly, when
he and Ken joined the others in the Brentwood <i>Advance</i>
office. “Ken came downstairs in the middle of the night
and—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No!” Bert leaped to his feet with an expression of
mock horror. “You mean he found Mom peeping in the
box?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>Sandy didn’t even laugh. “Tell them, Ken.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken made his report as brief as possible. “You can see
the scratches on the lock yourselves,” he concluded,
“when we go back to the house.” He turned to his father.
“And if somebody also broke into your apartment
last night, Dad, it certainly looks—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Bert’s laugh interrupted him. “It’s not enough for you
two to imagine one burglar. Oh, no—you can do better
than that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nobody tried to burglarize my apartment, Ken,”
Holt said. “I just didn’t lock it properly myself.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How do you know?” Ken asked. “Can you be sure,
Dad?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Doesn’t it seem strange,” Sandy put in, “that the
minute you land in the country somebody breaks into
the house where you’re staying, and at the same time
your own apartment is mysteriously—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Bert was still laughing. “You’re just not used to the
way these two carry on,” he told Ken’s father. “Every
time they see a doughnut they begin to worry about
who stole the middle out of it. Anything for a mystery—that’s
their philosophy.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now wait a minute,” Pop said mildly. “It does sound
as if there might be a sneak thief around Brentwood.
We don’t have them often, but I suppose Christmas
is a likely time, with everybody’s house full of presents.
I’ll call Andy Kane and tell him to alert the force. That
satisfy you?” He looked at Ken and Sandy. “But I will
not,” he added, “call the New York police chief with a
similar suggestion. So you two just take your dark
suspicions out of here, and get over to Sam Morris’s
while he’s still got time to fix that catch.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>Ken and Sandy looked at each other. Ken smiled first.</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right,” he said. “I guess that does make sense.
Come on, Sandy. But save your best stories until we get
back, Dad.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As soon as they arrived at the jeweler’s shop they
were glad they had waited no longer. The place was
crowded with customers, all wearing the harried expression
of those who have delayed their Christmas
shopping until the last possible moment. Sam Morris
and his two clerks looked equally harried as they tried
to wait on several people at a time.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken and Sandy chose the least crowded area along
the glass-topped display counter that bisected the store
lengthwise, running back toward Morris’s partitioned-off
workroom at the rear. After they had waited for a
few minutes, Sam, hurrying past with a heavy mahogany
mantel clock, noticed their presence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll be with you as soon as I can, boys,” he murmured.
He put the clock down in front of a woman several
feet away, told her to take her time examining it,
and came back to where Ken and Sandy stood.</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is the box, Sam,” Sandy explained, lifting it out
of its carton. “The catch broke when it fell. See?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam studied the injury, murmuring, “Nice workmanship.
Nice. Yes—ought to be able to fix that all right.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A hand holding a wrist watch thrust itself between
the two boys, and a voice behind them said politely,
“Excuse me. Could you put a new crystal in this watch
while I wait?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Down the counter the woman studying the mahogany
clock called out, “Mr. Morris, I think I like the
one you showed me first. May I see that again?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>“I’ll be right back,” Sam muttered, and hurried away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I certainly picked a fine day to break the crystal of
my watch,” the man behind the boys said, and they
turned to smile sympathetically into his pleasant middle-aged
face. “If it weren’t such a good timepiece, I’d
let it go for a while, but I hate to have it get dirty.”</p>

<p class='c015'>When Sam hurried back, looking more harried than
ever, he shook his head at the customer behind the
boys. “I’m sorry,” he said, “but I’m mighty busy today,
and it takes quite awhile to cement a crystal into place.”
He took the small iron box from Sandy’s hands.</p>

<p class='c015'>The owner of the watch spoke up quickly. “Don’t
bother with cement,” he said. “If you could just snap a
crystal into place, I could get it cemented after Christmas,
in New York. I’m just passing through Brentwood
and—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam shrugged. “All right. I could do that. Come back
in about half an hour.” He took the watch. “You too,”
he added to the boys. “I’ll try to have this ready by
then. Won’t take me long—if I just have a chance to get
at it.” He moved rapidly toward the partition at the
rear.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s certainly an accommodating gentleman,” the
owner of the watch said, as all three of them began to
edge their way through the crowd together.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He certainly is,” Ken agreed. “If I owned a store I
wouldn’t open the doors on Christmas Eve.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“See you in half an hour,” the man said with a
friendly wave as they separated on the sidewalk to go
in opposite directions.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>Back at the office they found Richard Holt in the
middle of one of the lively tales he always brought back
from his trips. “And they found that the phones in the
police chief’s own office were being tapped,” he was
saying. “So—” He broke off as the boys entered. “What
luck?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’ll be O.K.,” Ken told him. “Sam said we could
pick it up in half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good,” his father said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good,” Pop echoed, almost absent-mindedly. “Go
on, Dick. Did they ever find out who was doing the
wire tapping?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Richard Holt grinned. “It was the old woman who
cleaned the office. They certainly never would have
suspected her—she looked too old and harmless. But
she got jittery finally, and disappeared. And they were
curious enough to investigate. Now, I understand, you
can’t get a job cleaning the municipal offices there unless
you’re recommended by the prime minister himself.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wow!” Bert said. “What a yarn! Did they track
down the rest of the gang then too?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What’s this all about?” Ken wanted to know. “Start
from the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s not a very lively story, except for the old lady,”
Mr. Holt assured the boys. “Just an ordinary tale of
slick counterfeiters, though they did have an expert engraver
capable of turning out beautifully engraved ten-dollar
bills. United States bills, that is, which are always
popular in Europe, and therefore easy to pass. Of course
the banks could spot them, and they did eventually—a
few at a time. But as long as the gang had its wire-tapping
service in operation, it could keep informed as to
police suspicions—and shift its plates and its printing
apparatus to a new location if the police began to make
inquiries in the neighborhood where they were.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>“Did they track down the gang?” Bert persisted.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Unfortunately not,” Richard Holt admitted. “And
you can imagine how the police chief felt, under the
circumstances. He’s pretty sure they’ve cleared out of
his territory, but of course that’s not enough to satisfy
him. And of course the U.S. Treasury isn’t very happy
about it either. Last I heard, it was sending some T-men
over to lend a hand, because the counterfeits were
American bills.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Bert nodded. “Those T-men work fast. We received
a circular here about six months ago, about some bad
twenties that were turning up in this vicinity. But before
we could print the story, the counterfeiters were
nabbed. Of course,” he added, “most counterfeit bills
here are made by the photoengraving process, and
that’s pretty crude compared to a good engraving.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Pop grinned. “People complain these days about the
low standards of craftsmanship, but in some ways it’s a
help. There aren’t many engravers in this country who
can turn out a good set of plates, and what few there
are, are working for the Bureau of Engraving in Washington
or for some legitimate private business.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course there was one case, years ago,” Holt said.
“I was just a cub reporter at the time, but I happened
to be involved. I remember....”</p>

<p class='c015'>He was off on another yarn. Almost an hour went by
before Sandy happened to glance at the clock.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hey!” He jumped up. “Sam Morris said half an
hour.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>The wail of a siren and the sudden clanging of the
fire-engine’s bell seemed to put an exclamation mark at
the end of his sentence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Vacation or no vacation, a fire is news,” Pop said.
He reached for the phone, dialed rapidly, and spoke a
few brisk questions into the mouthpiece. Then he
slammed the receiver down.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Get going, Ken,” he said. “You too, Sandy. This
might be good for a picture. The fire’s at Sam Morris’s
jewelry shop!”</p>

    <div>A SCRAP OF FILM</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The area in front of Morris’s store was one of vast confusion.
A hook-and-ladder truck blocked it off from the
east and a chemical truck from the west. Traffic had
piled up behind both of them, in a solid mass. And the
sidewalks were jammed with people. It looked as if
everyone in Brentwood had converged on the spot.</p>

<p class='c015'>The voice of Andy Kane, chief of Brentwood’s five-man
police force, rose over the hubbub. “All right, keep
moving there!” he shouted. “There’s nothing to see
here, folks. Keep moving!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken and Sandy squeezed through to him. Chief Kane
glared when he saw them. “There’s nothing for you
here either,” he said. “That’s the fire—the whole thing!”
He pointed a scornful finger at a metal wastebasket
standing in the middle of the street, still smoking
faintly but now safely covered with the white foam
from chemical extinguishers.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So that’s all it is!” Sandy’s glance took in the busy
policemen, urging the crowd along, the two great fire
engines with their coils of hose, the firemen in heavy
black waterproofs, and the jammed traffic.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>“This is something the fire chief will want to remember,”
he said with a grin. “See you later,” he added to
Ken, and disappeared into the crowd with his camera.</p>

<p class='c015'>A few minutes later Ken spotted him on the roof of
Morris’s two-story building, aiming his lens at the
crowd below and at the small foam-shrouded wastebasket
at its center. When Sandy rejoined Ken again he
was still grinning.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll print this up for the chief’s New Year’s card,”
Sandy said. Then he straightened his face quickly as
Chief Dick James emerged from the jewelry store.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Everything under control, Chief?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>James nodded shortly. “Total damage one wastebasket
and a black smudge on about five square feet of
wall. Quick thinking on Sam Morris’s part, of course,”
he added, “or it might have been a real fire. The minute
he saw flames coming out of the basket he picked it up
and carried it into the street.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How’d it start?” Ken asked. “Cigarette?”</p>

<p class='c015'>James shrugged. “Probably. Or a still-burning match.
People are so danged careless. Wonder it doesn’t happen
oftener, the way they toss stuff around.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy, bending over the wastebasket, sniffed curiously.
“Smell this thing, Chief,” he said. “Maybe it’s my
imagination.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What are you imagining?” But James bent over the
basket and took a deep breath. Then he looked up with
the same puzzlement that Sandy showed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right, masterminds,” Ken said. “What gives?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Film,” Sandy said. “Or at least that’s what it smells
like. But why would there be film in Sam’s basket?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>“That’s a good question,” James said. “Let’s go ask
Sam if he’s got the answer.” But before they went inside
the shop he called one of his men over and instructed
him to take the wastebasket to the firehouse and examine
it carefully.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were fewer customers inside the store than
there had been earlier, but otherwise it looked very
much as it had earlier that morning. Sam Morris, wearing
a smoky streak down one cheek, came forward to
speak to them.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sorry about all the excitement, Chief,” he said.
“Your box is repaired,” he added to the boys.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gosh!” Ken said. “I’d forgotten all about it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Would there have been any film in that wastebasket,
Sam?” James asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Film?” The jeweler looked blank. “What kind of
film?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We don’t know,” James said. “We’re not even sure
if that’s what it was, but that’s what it smells like.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam shook his head. “I don’t know what was in the
basket. It stands over there, beneath that desk.” He
pointed to a writing shelf built against one wall, for
the use of customers who wanted to fill out cards to
enclose with gifts. “It’s usually almost empty, except
for a couple of cards that have been blotted or spoiled,
or maybe an empty cigarette package. I don’t know
why anybody would have thrown film in it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Film is inflammable stuff,” James pointed out.
“Maybe somebody wanted to start a fire in here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“A pyromaniac?” Sam looked unbelieving.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>James shook his head. “I was thinking of a crook—a
man smart enough to start a fire, so that he could make
off with a handful of rings, or watches, during the excitement.
Have you checked your stock, Sam?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Morris shook his head. “It didn’t occur to me. I had
the basket out in the street in a couple of seconds, and
then I came right back in. My clerks were here all the
time.” He smiled wearily. “There wasn’t half as much
excitement in the store as there was out in the street
after the trucks arrived.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where were you when the blaze started up?” James
asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Behind the partition—in the workroom.” Morris
gestured toward the rear wall broken by a single door
and a windowlike gap above a ledge. “I’d just finished
putting in a watch crystal for the man who was here
when you boys were in earlier,” he added to Sandy and
Ken. “He’d been waiting for a few minutes and I was
just handing him his watch through the window there
when one of the customers yelled ‘Fire!’ I saw the
smoke right away, and I ran out of the workroom
through that door and carried the basket to the street.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You don’t know what merchandise was out on top
of the counter at the time?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, I don’t, Chief. But I can find out.” Morris hurried
off and held brief consultations with both his
clerks. When he came back he looked relieved.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There were no small items being displayed just
then,” he said. “One clerk was showing electric percolators,
and the other was displaying cut glass to one
customer and selling a smoking set to another one at
the same time.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>James still didn’t look entirely satisfied. “Check your
rings and watches and other small stuff as soon as you
get a chance, Sam, and let me know if anything’s
missing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right,” Morris agreed. “But I still don’t think
there was anything deliberate about that fire. It must
have been just a careless smoker who threw a match in
the basket.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You didn’t see that happen, did you?” Sandy asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—and my clerks didn’t either. I asked them. We
were just too busy to be looking around.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure.” James nodded. “Well, maybe we’re guessing
wrong about this film business. But if we run down anything
we’ll let you know.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t forget your box, boys.” Morris hurried back
to the window in the rear partition, reached a hand
through, and lifted it from a shelf just inside the
opening.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How much do we owe you, Sam?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam smiled. “Since when do I charge a good friend
for a few minutes’ work?” He shook his head. “Go on—beat
it. Just see if you can get it home without dropping
it again.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys thanked him and left the store with James.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Give us a ring if you really do turn up some film in
that basket, will you, Chief?” Sandy asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Back in the <i>Advance</i> office Ken handed the box to
his father. “We’ve got Mom’s present all right, but we
haven’t got much of a story.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We haven’t got much of a story yet,” Sandy corrected
him.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>“What does the ‘yet’ mean?” Pop demanded, while
Richard Holt lifted the cardboard lid and assured himself
that the catch on the little iron box was now in perfect
working order.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy explained the possibility of incendiarism.
Bert’s automatic hoot of laughter died when he realized
that Chief James shared Sandy’s suspicion.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But if Sam says nothing was missing, it doesn’t
sound like a grab-and-run deal,” Pop pointed out.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He doesn’t <i>think</i> anything is missing,” Sandy reminded
him. “He might still find—” He broke off as
the phone rang.</p>

<p class='c015'>A moment later Sandy was talking to the caller who
had asked for him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No kidding?” he said. “About six inches? And thirty-five
millimeter, huh? Did you find a cartridge or a
spool?” He listened for another moment and then said
“Sure. Thanks, Chief,” and hung up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I guess you all heard that.” There was a note of
triumph in Sandy’s voice. “They found a six-inch scrap
of thirty-five-millimeter film in the wastebasket. My
guess is it’s the remains of a roll for a candid camera
like mine.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That still doesn’t make it an incendiary job,” Bert
said firmly. “Probably some customer of Sam’s had just
picked the roll up at a drugstore, where he was having
it developed. He looked at it while he was waiting in
Sam’s, saw that it was no good, and threw it away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Could be.” Richard Holt nodded his agreement. “Of
course anybody should know better than to throw film
into a public wastebasket where it might cause just
this kind of trouble. But there are always careless people
around.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>“Write just a brief paragraph on the fire, Ken,” Pop
said decisively. “Then, if Sam does report anything
missing among his stock, we’ll go to work on it.” He
turned to Dick Holt. “Did Sam do a good job on your
box?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perfect,” Ken’s father assured him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Fine. I’m not surprised. Sam’s a good man.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And he wouldn’t let us pay for it, Dad,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Pop smiled. “I’m not surprised at that either. Here,
I’ll help you with that, Dick,” he added, as the correspondent
brought out the wrapping paper and ribbon
he had put into his overcoat pocket that morning
at the house.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken and Sandy were alone in the office that noon.
Pop and Bert had carried Richard Holt off to their
weekly lunch club meeting.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t cook up any more mysteries,” Bert had
warned as he left.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mysteries!” Sandy made a face at his brother’s disappearing
back. “Every time we ask a simple question
we’re accused of stirring up trouble.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken slipped a sheet of paper into his typewriter and
twirled the roller. “We don’t do badly,” he said, smiling.
“Maybe they’ve got some reason to suspect us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy stared. “Whose side are you on, anyway? You
were the one who started the whole business this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure—sure. And I’m not satisfied about that business
yet. But I guess maybe it was a little too much
when we came tearing in with talk about an incendiary
fire. Especially,” Ken added pointedly, “in view of
something I remember you telling me a while ago.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>“What was that?” Sandy asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You told me that modern camera film is called safety
film because it does <i>not</i> go up in flames, fast—the way
film used to do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s right,” Sandy agreed. “It doesn’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then why would anybody deliberately try to start
a fire with film?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy smiled. “A really smart crook wouldn’t,
maybe,” he admitted. “If he was somebody like you,
for example, who had had the benefit of my educational
conversation. But film used to be very inflammable, and
it probably still has that reputation with a lot of people.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken looked unconvinced. “I still don’t think it was
very smart of you to become suspicious just because
you smelled film in that basket. After all, if a man
plans to rob a jewelry store, and his success depends on
a good rousing fire, you’d think he’d look into the subject
a little first. That he’d make sure he had the right
materials on hand.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I thought maybe this wasn’t carefully
planned,” Sandy said argumentatively. “Couldn’t it
have been done on impulse—on the spur of the moment?
In that case you might easily duck into a drugstore
and buy a roll of film. It’s easy to carry around.
It’s not noticeable. It’s—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wait a minute!” Ken broke in suddenly. “Maybe it
all fits together!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Maybe all what fits together?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s the iron box—Mom’s present! That’s what’s doing
it.” Ken folded his arms over his typewriter and
rested his chin on them, staring at the gaily wrapped
package that now stood on Pop’s desk. “Yes, that’s it.
I’m sure of it.” His voice was tense.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>“Are you out of your mind?” Sandy demanded.
“What are you talking about? What’s the little iron
box—?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Listen,” Ken said. “It’s all perfectly obvious. That
box is important to somebody. The somebody, whoever
he is, knew Dad was bringing it home with him. He—the
somebody, I mean—went to Dad’s apartment last
night looking for it. It wasn’t there. He knows something
about Dad—at least enough to realize that he
was coming to Brentwood. So later last night he tried
to break into the house here, but I scared him off. He
must have hung around, saw that we were taking the
box to Sam Morris’s this morning, and made another attempt
there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And there he is foiled again!” There was laughter
behind Sandy’s mock-dramatic voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Right,” Ken said. “Because, as you explained to me
yourself, he made a bad choice of material for his fire.
He wants to create a diversion. He has some vague idea
that film is inflammable, and dashes into the nearest
drugstore to get some. He slips into the crowd at Sam’s,
drops it into the wastebasket, along with a lit match,
and then—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy, openly grinning now, picked it up. “And then
sees his whole villainous dream go up in a tiny cloud
of smoke.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Right,” Ken said again, more firmly than ever. “Because,
for one thing, the fire only lasts a second. And,
for another, that man waiting for his watch crystal is
standing right in front of the window, unconsciously
protecting the box on the shelf inside. Sam told us he
was there when it happened. Remember?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>“Oh, I remember all right,” Sandy admitted. “But
the whole thing sounds like a hallucination, my friend.
In the first place, why would anybody particularly want
the box? Your father told us it wasn’t valuable—that
he picked it up from the porter in the Rome office.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s an antique,” Ken pointed out.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure. So is any old stone you can find in a field.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look,” Ken said, “I don’t know <i>why</i> anybody wants
the box. But it looks to me as if somebody does. I was
right about somebody breaking into the house last
night. You were right about the film in Sam’s wastebasket,
which is certainly an odd place for film to be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy stood up abruptly. “O.K.,” he said. “Maybe
we can check that part of your nightmare, anyway. If
somebody bought that film with the deliberate purpose
of starting a fire, he probably got it in Schooley’s photo
shop right across the street from Sam’s. Let’s go and
find out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They grabbed their coats and started for the door.
Ken picked up the box from Pop’s desk on the way.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think I’ll keep my hands on this—just in case,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c015'>The photographic supply shop was as crowded as
Sam’s store had been. Several minutes went by before
the boys could catch the attention of one of the clerks.</p>

<p class='c015'>But finally one of them said, “Hi, Sandy. What is it
today? Film or flash bulbs?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Neither,” Sandy told him. “Just some information.
Did you sell a roll of thirty-five millimeter this morning?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>The clerk’s eyebrows rose. “Are you crazy? I must
have sold at least fifty. In case you don’t know it, chum,
tomorrow is Christmas and quite a few people seem to
want to take pictures that day.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know,” Sandy said, “but—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wait,” Ken interrupted. “Let’s put it this way. Did
you sell any to a man who either didn’t seem to know
anything about film, or who didn’t care what kind he
bought?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The clerk’s eyebrows rose another fraction of an inch.
“Of all the idiotic—” he began, and then stopped. He
looked at the boys sharply for an instant, and then
called over his shoulder to a fellow clerk. “Rick! Got a
second?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Rick left his customer who was examining a small
camera and joined them. “What’s up?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Didn’t you tell me about some queer duck who came
in this morning to buy film and didn’t know what size
he wanted or what speed or anything?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Rick nodded. “Sure. He just asked for film. When I
asked what size, he said it didn’t matter. And then
when I kind of stared at him he said it was for a little
camera. I figured he meant a miniature job, so I suggested
a cartridge of thirty-five millimeter and he said
that would be fine. But he didn’t know whether he
wanted color film or black and white, and he didn’t
know what I was talking about when I mentioned high-speed
stuff. I finally gave him a spool of the cheapest
film we have, just to get rid of him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken made an effort to keep his voice calm. “Do you
remember what he looked like?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>“I probably wouldn’t remember my own mother if
she came in here today,” Rick said with a grin. “But I
do recall one more funny thing about that guy,” he
added suddenly. “Right after he left I had to reach into
the front window for a camera some customer wanted
to see, and I noticed him crossing the street. The dumb
cluck was opening the cartridge box and exposing the
film to the light! He’s sure going to be in for a surprise
when he tries to take pictures with it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wouldn’t worry about it,” Ken said, beginning to
pull Sandy away. “I doubt if he planned to take any
pictures at all.”</p>

    <div>BOOBY TRAP</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The cuckoo stuck his head out of the old wall clock to
announce that the hour of seven had arrived. But nobody
in the Allen house that evening bothered to listen
to him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Tiny Mom Allen, in a rustling new housecoat, appeared
unaware of even the wild litter of crumpled
paper wrappings and ribbons that surrounded her. In
her lap lay the iron box, and her fingers were already
busy fitting together the bits of velvet with which she
was lining it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Pop was smoke-screening the room with a handsome
new meerschaum that Richard Holt had brought him
from Europe, and happily leafing through a huge new
world atlas that had so far provided an answer for every
question he could contrive.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bert, resplendent in a British tweed sports coat,
swung his new golf clubs one by one, in reckless arcs
that threatened every window and every piece of bric-a-brac
in the house.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>Richard Holt was trying out a new portable typewriter,
a lightweight model especially designed for
globe-trotters like himself. “It even spells better than
my old one,” he had announced.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken, after an hour’s experimentation, was still finding
new gadgets on the chronometer his father had bought
for him in Switzerland. It was a stop watch and completely
waterproof, and it told the date and the phases
of the moon as well as the hour of the day.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Got it!” Sandy’s exclamation broke a long silence.
He gestured with the tiny camera he held in his hand.
“I knew this thing must have a delayed-action timer on
it some place—it’s got everything else. And I finally
found it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He made a few swift adjustments on the little mechanism,
moved a lever, and then set the camera down on
the table, lens toward the room. It made a faint buzzing
sound. Sandy waded through torn papers to his mother’s
side, putting his arm around her shoulders an instant
before the buzzing stopped with a sharp click.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How do you like that, Mom?” he demanded. “I just
took our picture.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Doesn’t seem possible that anything so tiny could
really work,” Mom said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It does, though,” Sandy assured her, returning to
the table to reset the camera that was only half the size
of a cigarette package.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No more of me,” Mom said firmly, getting up and
putting her box on an already well-laden table. “I have
to get those dishes cleared away. Any volunteers?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Pop peered at her through the haze of smoke. “My
old army training, Mom, taught me never to volunteer
for anything.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>“In that case,” Mom said, “I’ll have to draft you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Finally they all got up and followed Mom into the
big Allen kitchen. She excused Sandy and Ken from
duty, on the grounds that they had done the dishes the
night before, and put Bert to work at the sink. Ken’s
father and Pop dried.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Bring me my box, Ken,” Mom said, when she had
everyone organized. “I’ve got so much help here I can
get back to work on my velvet lining.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The brightly lighted room gave Sandy all the opportunity
he needed to make further use of his new
camera.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t wait to finish up this first roll,” he explained,
taking one picture after another. “As soon as it’s done
I’m going right down to the office and develop it. Hold
it, Bert. Just one more. There, that does it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Guess I’ll go along,” Ken said. “Want to come,
Dad?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I do not,” Holt said. “Holding this dish towel is all
the activity I can manage after so much excitement.
Besides, I’m husbanding my strength for tomorrow’s
turkey.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys, having decided to walk the few short
blocks to the <i>Advance</i> office, put on their heavy lumberjackets.
But when they went through the front door
Ken turned back toward the rear of the house.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hey,” Sandy said, “I thought we were going to
leave the car.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We are. I just want to check something.” Ken followed
the walk they had cleared that morning, until he
was standing outside the kitchen windows. “I just want
to see how much of the room is visible from out here,”
he said quietly. “Hmm. Practically all of it, except the
corner where the door leads into the hall.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>“So what?” Sandy demanded.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So now we know that if somebody was standing out
here last night,” Ken answered, leading the way back
toward the front sidewalk, “he could have seen us put
the iron box in the shoe box, and leave it there on the
sideboard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Neither of them spoke for the distance of a block.
Their feet were crunching on the snow at a cross street
when Sandy said, “Well, so long as you don’t quote me,
I’ll admit that business at Schooley’s this afternoon has
me a little worried. I still don’t see exactly why you’re
fastening on the box as somebody’s special target, but
it does all sound slightly fishy. I don’t think we’d get
any sympathy if we talked about it at the house, though—especially
now that your father’s here, to help Pop
and Bert out with their usual ribbing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We won’t tell them about it until we have some
more proof,” Ken assured him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“More proof?” Sandy emphasized the first word.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure.” Ken ignored the skepticism in his voice. “I
think we’ve already got some. And if somebody makes
another attempt to break into the house tonight—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Huh? Nice cheerful thoughts you have.” Sandy
scooped up a handful of snow and packed it thoughtfully
between his gloved hands. “But maybe you’re
right. At least you may be near enough right so that we
ought to put the chains on both doors tonight.” Sandy
hurled his snowball at a hydrant and hit it squarely.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?” Sandy repeated blankly. “Because you just
told me somebody might be planning to try to get in.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>“Exactly. And if the attempt fails, we’d have no
proof that it ever happened.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perhaps,” Sandy said politely, “you could express
yourself a little more clearly. It would require a great
effort, of course, but won’t you just try for my sake?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken grinned. “In words of approximately one syllable,”
he said, “what I’m suggesting is that we make it
easy for someone to get in, but that we be on hand to
catch him. In other words, that we set a booby trap.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy gave one loud agonized groan and then announced
that he refused to discuss the matter. Down
in the basement darkroom, beneath the <i>Advance</i> office,
he went about the business of mixing up his developing
solutions in dignified silence. With a great show of concentration
he figured out a method for suspending the
tiny film from his new camera in a tank designed for
much larger film. He turned out the lights, put the roll
into the tank, fastened the lightproof cover in place
and then turned the lights on again.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let’s see,” he muttered to himself. “I’m using the
finest grain developer I have. I’d better give it fourteen
minutes.” Carefully he set his timer.</p>

<p class='c015'>“While I’m here,” he said then, still talking to himself,
“I might as well develop that print of the fire this
afternoon. If I want to print it up in time to mail to
Chief James as a New Year’s card....”</p>

<p class='c015'>Once more his hands were busy, and he turned the
lights off and on again.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There,” he said finally. “If it’s a good negative I’ll
make a nice big print of it, so he can hang it up in his
office, labeled ‘Firemen at Work.’”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>For the first time since they had come into the darkroom
he turned around to look at Ken. His black-haired
friend was conscientiously rocking the first film tank
back and forth, as Sandy had so often asked him to do
in the past.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thanks,” Sandy said. “That ought to be enough
now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re quite welcome. Any time.” Ken sat down,
stretched out his legs, and stared up at the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy’s mouth finally split in a wide grin. “All right,”
he said. “I give up. What kind of booby trap?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken spoke as if there had been no interruption in
their conversation.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The important thing is to set it without the folks
knowing anything.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You can say that again,” Sandy murmured.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So we can’t do much about it until everybody’s in
bed.” Ken looked down at his new watch. “I can’t tell
if it’s quarter to nine or December twenty-fourth.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It might be both,” Sandy said helpfully.</p>

<p class='c015'>“By gum, I believe you’re right.” They grinned at
each other briefly. “O.K.,” Ken said then, “you have just
proved what I always suspected—that you’re the mechanical
genius in this outfit. You figure it out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What’s difficult about it? We leave the chains off
both doors. We sit in utter darkness—in the living
room, say, where we couldn’t possibly be seen by anybody
entering either door. And when somebody comes
in—<i>if</i> somebody comes in—” His involved sentence
broke off in a vast yawn.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken yawned too. “He finds us,” he said, when he
could speak, “fast asleep. He takes the box. He departs.”
He sat up and shook himself. “That is not my
idea of a booby trap.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>The timer bell rang just then, and for the next several
minutes they were busy. The activity roused them a
little, but before the films were hanging from their drying
clips both Ken and Sandy had yawned again.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy tried to examine the tiny strip of film with a
magnifying glass. “It looks great,” he muttered. “Wish
it were dry already, so I could try printing them up.
Wonder how big an enlargement I’ll be able to make.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look,” Ken said, “don’t start getting any ideas about
staying down here half the night to work on them. If
the rest of the family is half as sleepy as we are, they’ll
be turning in early tonight. And we’d better be there if
we really want to watch for a visitor.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right,” Sandy agreed. “I’m coming. I offer only
one slight correction to your theory. We’d better be
there—with a cup of coffee.”</p>

<p class='c015'>When they turned the corner into the Allen’s block
their suspicions about others being as sleepy as they
were themselves seemed confirmed. The living-room
light winked out as they watched, and a moment later
the light went on in the big corner bedroom that belonged
to Pop and Mom Allen. There was also a light in
the room Richard Holt was occupying. Bert’s room was
already dark.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ken—Sandy—is that you?” Mom called down as
they let themselves in.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy answered with a standing family joke. “No,
Mom. There’s nobody here but us chickens.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I just wanted to be sure,” Mom replied calmly.
“There’s some cake left—and plenty of milk.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>“Thanks, Mom.” Sandy lowered his voice. “Let’s not
rattle the coffeepot. Let her think we’re having our
usual quick snack before going to bed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It was half past ten when they turned out the kitchen
light, leaving the entire house in darkness. Quietly they
tiptoed into the living room and settled themselves on
the couch.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t get too comfortable,” Ken warned, “or you’ll
fall asleep.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t worry. I’m wide awake now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a few minutes of complete silence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re sure you’re awake?” Ken whispered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Huh? What?” Sandy stirred.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken poked him. “This is never going to work,” he
said. “I was almost asleep myself. Coffee has certainly
been overrated as a stimulant.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We could take turns,” Sandy murmured. “If I just
took a short nap now, you could—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, you don’t,” Ken said. “Get up. Walk around a
little.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“In a room littered with Christmas presents? I’d
stumble over something right away and wake up the
whole house.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” Ken said, “I told you to rig up a booby trap.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come on.” Sandy stood up, a shadowy figure in the
faint light reflected into the room from the moonlit
snow outside.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“To rig up a booby trap. To fasten a lot of noisy pots
and pans up over the door, so that even if we are asleep
we’ll hear anybody trying to get in.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Those things never work,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>“Mine will,” Sandy insisted. He crossed the room to
the desk and cautiously prodded among its cubbyholes.
“This is what I want—this light adhesive tape.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then he led the way to the kitchen where they
opened the cupboard door as quietly as possible and
lifted out a six-quart kettle and several smaller pans.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Pie tins,” Sandy whispered. “They make a good
clatter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Got them,” Ken murmured.</p>

<p class='c015'>Using small pieces of tape they fastened several pans
over the back door, so lightly that the opening of the
door would be sure to pull them from their place.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If anybody opens this enough even to put a finger
in, these things will come down,” Sandy whispered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If they don’t come down by their own weight the
minute we turn our backs,” Ken added.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t criticize. A booby trap was your idea,” Sandy
reminded him.</p>

<p class='c015'>By the time the clock struck eleven the front door
had been similarly rigged, and the boys were back in
their place on the couch.</p>

<p class='c015'>Stillness settled over the house. A board, creaking
by itself in the dry night air, sounded like the noise of
a pistol shot. The ticking of the clock at the far end of
the room was as clear and distinct as if it were right
beside them. When a car passed several blocks away
both boys roused out of a near sleep and came to their
feet. But after a few seconds of tense waiting they settled
down again sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We going to stay here all night?” Sandy asked, when
the cuckoo had struck twelve and then twelve thirty.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>Ken answered him with a warning hand on his arm.
There were footsteps on the porch steps. Both boys
listened intently, every nerve alert. Ken could feel
Sandy’s big body tense itself for action.</p>

<p class='c015'>Carefully they came to their feet. With Sandy in the
lead they drifted silently across the carpet, following
the path they had cleared for themselves earlier.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a fumbling at the outer storm door, which
was unlocked as usual.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken had one finger ready on the light switch. Sandy
was crouched low, ready to pounce.</p>

<p class='c015'>Metal scratched faintly against metal. Hands worked
cautiously at the lock of the inner door. An almost inaudible
rattle told them that the mechanism was clicking
open. The knob began to turn.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then the door itself eased slowly open. And suddenly,
with an unearthly clatter, the pots and pans
rigged above it crashed to the floor, cascading over a
figure outlined in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c015'>As Ken snapped on the light, Sandy leaped forward.
His arms circled the intruder, and the two heavy bodies
thudded to the floor.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken barely had time to notice that Sandy was safely
on top when a shout sounded from upstairs.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hey! What’s going on?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken lunged for the intruder’s feet and hung on. “It’s
all right, Pop!” he called. “We got him!” Out of the
corner of his eye he could see Pop Allen tearing down
the stairs, with Richard Holt right behind him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ve got me all right.” The muffled voice spoke
from somewhere beneath Sandy’s considerable weight.
“But why?” it grunted. “Just tell me why?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>Ken’s hands jerked away from the feet he was holding
as if they had burned him. In the same instant
Sandy rolled aside, freeing his victim.</p>

<p class='c015'>And then both boys scrambled hastily out of the way
as a furious red-faced Bert, pushing aside pots and
pans, got slowly to his feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gosh!” Ken said. “Gee, Bert—we thought you were
upstairs asleep!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure,” Sandy echoed. “We thought—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Sandy looked at Ken and Ken looked at him.
There didn’t seem to be anything else to say.</p>

    <div>THE MISSING OUNCES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It was only when the glistening brown turkey was carried
to the dinner table the next day that the boys had
any relief from the constant barrage of kidding they
had been receiving all morning.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I never thought I’d have to urge the menfolks of my
family to put their minds on food,” Mom said, “but that
is exactly what I’m doing. The boys have had enough
teasing. After all, they’re not always wrong.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thanks, Mom,” Sandy said, sliding into his chair.</p>

<p class='c015'>“All the same,” Ken said, “I still—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you start all over again, Ken,” Mom warned, “I
won’t be responsible.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken smiled at her. “O.K., Mom.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Dinner conversation was limited to murmured comments
about the food, which Richard Holt insisted was
better than any he had ever had in the most famous
restaurants of the world. And after dinner a heavy
peace settled on the household, broken only when occasional
callers dropped in for brief holiday visits. Outside
it had grown slightly warmer, but the gray sky
promised more snow. By six o’clock heavy snowflakes
were falling steadily.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>Richard Holt roused himself from a sleepy contemplation
of the fire. “This is no night for you boys to
drive me into New York,” he announced. “I’ll take the
train instead.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why don’t you just stay over until morning?” Pop
suggested. “Doesn’t look as though this will last long.
The roads should be better then.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The correspondent shook his head. “Wish I could.
But I promised Granger I’d be in early tomorrow morning
to talk over that Washington assignment.” He
turned to the boys. “Unless you’re actually snowed in
here I’ll expect to see you tomorrow, as we’d planned.
I’ll meet you at the apartment in the afternoon, and
we’ll have dinner before the wrestling matches.” He
got to his feet. “Anybody have a timetable?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s a train leaving here at six fifty,” Bert told
him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good. I can make that easily.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ll at least drive you to the station, Dad,” Ken
said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And afterward we’ll print up those negatives, so we
can bring them in tomorrow to show you,” Sandy
added.</p>

<p class='c015'>About an hour later Sandy was proudly studying the
first print from his new camera. “Look at this,” he told
Ken. “A four-by-five print from a negative less than half
an inch square! That little peanut certainly has a wonderful
lens.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mmm,” Ken murmured. “Great.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>Sandy dropped the print back into the tray and prepared
to enlarge the next image on his tiny strip of
film. “Wish we’d gotten a picture of Bert snowed under
by pans last night,” he said, grinning over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think that event will live in our memories all right
without a picture to remind us,” Ken assured him.</p>

<p class='c015'>The phone rang as he finished the sentence and he
reached out to pick up the darkroom extension.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hello. Brentwood <i>Advance</i>,” he said automatically....
“Oh, Mr. Morris.... Yes, this is Ken.” He listened
for a moment. “No, we don’t,” he said then. “Never saw
him before.... Really? Well, he’ll probably get in
touch with you. I don’t see why you should have to
worry about it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What’s up?” Sandy asked, when Ken hung up the
receiver a moment later.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sam Morris wanted to know if that man with the
broken watch crystal was a friend of ours,” Ken reported.
“He remembered seeing us talk to him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?” Sandy asked, his voice preoccupied. He was
using a magnifier to focus the image being projected on
his enlarger easel.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The man had just given Sam a twenty-dollar bill to
pay for his crystal when the fire started,” Ken explained.
“Sam stuffed the bill in his pocket as he ran
out to pick up the wastebasket, and when he came back
later to give him his change the man had disappeared.
Sam thought he could send him his change if we knew
who he was.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nobody else but Sam would worry that much about
it,” Sandy said. “Anybody else would figure that if the
man wanted his change he’d come back for it—or remember
it in the first place.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>“I know.” Ken dropped into a chair. “But the man
said he was just passing through Brentwood, remember?
Maybe by the time he realized he’d forgotten his
change he was too far away to come back, and not
knowing Sam’s last name couldn’t call him up. Anyway,
that’s how Sam thinks it was.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wish we could have helped him out,” he went on
after a minute. “For the man’s sake as well as Sam’s. I
still think Mom would be out one jewel box if he hadn’t
been standing at that window when the fire happened.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You can’t prove that by what happened last night.”
Sandy grinned as he rocked a tray gently.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How right you are. Especially,” Ken admitted,
“since I stayed awake until daylight and can practically
swear nobody tried to get in the house all night.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Were you awake too?” Sandy grinned again. “So
was I—and without even trying. Every time I got
sleepy Bert’s face seemed to rise up before me and—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Same thing happened to me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Neither of them spoke then for some time. Sandy
worked steadily. Finally he said, “Here, make yourself
useful. Take these prints out of the hypo and set them
washing in the sink. I’m just going to print up that
picture of the fire and then I’ll call it a day.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure,” Ken agreed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look at this,” Sandy said a few minutes later. He
was holding up a wet eight-by-ten print and pointing
to one corner of it with a dripping forefinger. “Take a
look at that car,” he said, as Ken joined him. “The one
parked right across the street from Sam’s store.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m looking,” Ken told him. “What am I supposed
to see?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>“The man in it leaning out of the window to see
what’s going on,” Sandy told him impatiently. “Isn’t he
the one who was getting his watch crystal fixed?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken bent closer. “Sure enough! Must have been
caught in the traffic jam.” He took hold of Sandy’s
wrist and held it so that light fell more clearly on the
print. “Could you make the enlargement any bigger?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure. But why?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If we could read the license plate on that car maybe
we could help Sam out after all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s an idea. But we won’t need a print for that.
I’ll just make a larger projection.” Sandy dropped the
wet picture back into the tray, adjusted his enlarger to
a bigger image, and turned on the light. “Now you can
see the number,” he said, pointing to the tremendous
image on the easel.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Right. That does it.” Ken copied the number off on
a scrap of paper. “It’s a New York license. And I’ll bet
Dad can get the car owner’s name from the New York
Motor Vehicle Bureau. We’ll phone him when he’s had
a chance to reach home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy’s prints were all washed and on their drying
boards by the time Ken got his father on the telephone.
Richard Holt laughed when he first heard Ken’s request.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t tell me you’re on the track of another mystery,”
he said. “After last night—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is something else, Dad,” Ken broke in hurriedly.
He explained about Sam Morris’s phone call and
their subsequent discovery of the watch-owner’s car in
Sandy’s print. “Sam was so nice to us we just thought
we ought to try to help him out.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>“You’re right,” Richard Holt said quickly. “We
should. I’ll call Global and have the agency’s Albany
man put in an inquiry. Ought to have the owner’s name
for you tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“O.K. Swell, Dad. Sandy says to tell you the little
camera’s a honey,” he added before he hung up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You ready to go home now?” he asked Sandy.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I will be in a minute. Just want to take these prints
off the boards. Most of them are dry now.” One by one
he began to lift them from the chromium plates, examining
each one as he turned it face up. “Look at
them,” he said admiringly, reaching for his magnifying
glass. “I could enlarge them to eight-by-tens and still
have pretty sharp prints!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do your gloating at home,” Ken suggested. “I
wouldn’t have thought it possible, but I believe I’m
actually hungry.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy grinned. “Turkey sandwiches sound pretty
good to me too.” He put the prints into an envelope and
slipped them into his pocket, along with his magnifying
glass. “All right. Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As they walked away from the <i>Advance</i> office Sandy
said, “If there’s any of the dressing left I could do with
some of that too. And maybe even a piece of mince
pie.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken seemed too preoccupied to comment on the suggestion,
and when he finally spoke, Sandy had driven
the convertible halfway home. “There could be just one
reason for anybody wanting that box badly enough to
burglarize two houses and set a fire,” he declared. “It
must be valuable.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>“Now, look,” Sandy protested, maneuvering the car
carefully along the ruts of a snowy street. “We’ve been
through this. Your father said the box wasn’t valuable.
He ought to know. Besides, after last night—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dad isn’t an expert on antiques,” Ken interrupted.
“The only reason he thinks it isn’t valuable is because
he apparently didn’t pay very much for it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, apparently the man who sold it to your father
didn’t think it was very valuable either, or he’d have
asked more for it,” Sandy pointed out reasonably.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Maybe he had his own reasons for selling it
cheaply,” Ken said darkly. “Dad assumed it was part of
the porter’s own household stuff—heirlooms, I suppose—that
he was selling off because he was broke. But
suppose Dad was fooled? Suppose the box was stolen
and offered to Dad inexpensively, just so he’d buy it
and bring it through American customs. Then the idea
would be to steal it from him, once it was here, and sell
it for its real value.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But it hasn’t been stolen,” Sandy reminded him.
“Nobody tried to get it last night. Besides, there’s a
hole in your argument big enough to drive a truck
through. If a valuable box had been stolen, the customs
authorities would have been alerted to watch for it.
And no matter how well they know your father by now,
they’d have shown at least a little curiosity when he
turned up with something they’d been warned to watch
out for. In fact, they’d probably have landed on him
like a ton of bricks.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, maybe it isn’t <i>that</i> valuable,” Ken admitted.
“Maybe it’s not the sort of thing that would arouse an
international hunt.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>Sandy laughed. “I see. It’s only valuable enough to
cause two burglaries and an attempted arson. You’re
just not making sense, Ken.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy had driven the car into the Allen garage, but
he made no effort toward getting out. “I’m not going
into the house with you while you’re still on this subject,”
he announced. “I’ve stood all the ribbing I want
to take for one day. Well? Are you convinced?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken smiled faintly. “I’m convinced that your arguments
are unanswerable—for the moment,” he admitted.
“But do you honestly believe there’s no connection
at all between that unlocked door at Dad’s apartment,
the attempted entry into the house here, and the fire
at Sam’s?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy ran his gloved hand through his hair. “I’ll go
this far: I’ll agree they make a curious string of coincidences.
And you know how I mistrust coincidences.
But don’t ask me what the connection is. And don’t
expect me to believe that the box is a priceless antique.”
He turned the door handle. “And don’t go on about
this when we get inside,” he added menacingly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right,” Ken agreed. “I’m with you there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The rest of the Allens were already in the kitchen.
Pop, towering on one side of his tiny wife, was slicing
generous slabs of white meat from the turkey carcass.
Bert, towering on Mom’s other side, was cutting bread.
Mom, between them, was making sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ha!” Bert said. “The demon sleuths—and probably
on the trail of food this time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Lock up the pots and pans, Mom,” Pop contributed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now that will do,” Mom said firmly. “Boys, get the
milk from the icebox and get some glasses.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>Sandy brought his pictures out as soon as they had
sat down, to ensure a safe subject of conversation. “Look
what that little camera can do,” he announced proudly.</p>

<p class='c015'>The strategy was effective. Even Bert became engrossed.
And half an hour later, when the boys were
left alone in the kitchen to clean up, Bert forgot to
warn them against setting further booby traps as he
went up to bed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll wash,” Ken said. “We’d better put these things
away before they get splashed,” he added, beginning to
gather together the prints still spread out among the
dishes.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly he halted and bent low over the table.
“Where’s your magnifying glass?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here,” Sandy said, handing it to him. “Why?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was holding one print close to the light and peering
at it through the glass.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy grinned proudly. “Is that the one where you
can even tell what time it is by the kitchen clock?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s the one of Mom sitting alongside the cupboard.
But look where the box is—the iron box, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy shrugged. “I remember where it was then—on
the kitchen scale. Mom put it there while she was
working on the lining.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And you put it there the night Dad got home. Remember?”
There was mounting excitement in Ken’s
voice. “Just before Dad dropped it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s right. I did. So?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then you said something about how much it
weighed. Do you remember what you said?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy looked at him questioningly, but a moment
later he obediently wrinkled his brow in an effort to
recall the moment. “Let’s see. I said something about
how heavy it was for its size. And—wait—I think I
said it weighed exactly four and a half pounds.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>“That’s what I thought you said!” Ken sounded triumphant.
“But take a look at this. The box didn’t weigh
that much last night when you took this picture. Look
what the scale shows here. It’s considerably under four
and a half. Isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>He handed the picture and the magnifying glass to
Sandy, and Sandy studied the print carefully. “You’re
right,” he said slowly. “But this is a tiny image.
Maybe—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let’s check up. Mom hasn’t got the lining fastened
in yet. The box must weigh just what it did last night.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken disappeared for a moment and came back carrying
it in his hands. He put it on the kitchen scales, and
both boys watched silently as the pointer swung back
and forth in diminishing arcs. Finally it came to rest.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Four pounds and five ounces,” Sandy said wonderingly.
“But how can that be? I must have been wrong
the other night. But I was sure—” He broke off abruptly.
“Could Sam have done anything to the box to
reduce its weight? Do you suppose he had to take
something off in order to fix it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was still watching the scale as if fascinated. “He
just straightened the bent lever. Even if he had removed
it entirely that wouldn’t have reduced the
weight by three ounces.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He looked up, finally, into Sandy’s puzzled face. “I
don’t think this is the same box Dad brought home,”
Ken said.</p>

    <div>UNEXPECTED CALLER</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Sandy shot Ken one startled glance. He picked the box
up and hefted it in his hands, as if he might be a better
judge of its weight than the scales could be. Then he
put it slowly down again.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How could it not be the same box?” he demanded.
“When could a substitution have been made?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“At Sam’s,” Ken said quietly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mean you think Sam would—?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, of course not,” Ken interrupted. “But whoever
wanted the box—wanted the real one, I mean—found
out that we had taken it there for repairs, and when we
would come back for it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“This imaginary character you’re talking about must
have a crystal ball,” Sandy said scathingly.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken shook his head. “Just a broken watch crystal.”
Sandy stared at him unbelievingly, but Ken went on.
“What could have been simpler than breaking a watch
crystal, if somebody wanted an excuse to follow us into
Sam’s store and find out how long the box would be
there?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>Sandy ignored the question. Instead he asked one of
his own. “And do you also have a ‘simple’ explanation
for how the switch was made?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course,” Ken replied calmly. “We’ve been thinking
that it was fortunate the man with the watch crystal
was standing in front of that partition window when
the fire broke out. It wasn’t fortunate. It was planned.
It gave him the perfect opportunity to switch boxes
and walk out of the store.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy opened his mouth and shut it again.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What?” Ken prompted.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy grinned slightly. “I thought of something that
supports your crazy theory. I was going to say it would
explain why the man ‘forgot’ his change. He just wasn’t
interested in waiting around for it when he’d managed
to do what he came for.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken solemnly shook his hand. “Congratulations. That
clinches it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now wait a minute,” Sandy said hastily. “It doesn’t
do any such thing. We still haven’t any idea why somebody
should have wanted the box in the first place.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know. I know,” Ken told him. “You’ve explained
that once. If it’s a stolen art treasure, Dad wouldn’t
have been able to bring it into the country. And if it
isn’t really valuable....” his voice trailed off.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Exactly,” Sandy said. “I must have been wrong
about the weight that first night.” His voice sounded
almost pleading.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken ignored him. “Sam might be able to tell us if
this is the box he worked on,” he said suddenly. “Let’s
check with him tomorrow.” He straightened up, as if
relieved at having reached a decision. “And now let’s
finish up here, before Bert comes down to see if we’re
scheming up some new trick for his downfall.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>They were in Sam Morris’s store by nine the next
morning, the iron box under Sandy’s arm. Mom had
gone off right after breakfast to see her sister, so they
had been able to borrow her present without arousing
her suspicion.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Broken again?” Sam Morris asked, as Sandy unwrapped
the package.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No. It works fine, Sam. We just need your help in
settling an argument. Would you look at this thing
carefully and tell us if it’s the one you repaired?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“One of you boys thinks that perhaps it isn’t?” Sam
looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No.” Ken smiled at him. “But we have reason to believe
the box is lighter now than it was when my father
brought it here. And we didn’t see how the repair job
could have changed the weight.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It didn’t. I just straightened the lever. Do you think
I exchanged your box for another one?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course not,” Ken assured him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you think maybe someone did, eh?” Sam fitted
his jeweler’s glass into his eye. “It sounds like nonsense,
but let’s have a look.”</p>

<p class='c015'>After several minutes he removed the glass and shook
his head. “I can only say that I <i>think</i> this is the same
box I worked on. The lock mechanism is the same. But
I was in too much of a hurry to inspect the box carefully.
Still, I couldn’t testify under oath that this is it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The phone rang and Sam excused himself to answer
it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Satisfied now?” Sandy asked Ken.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>Before Ken could answer, Sam was calling him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is for you, Ken,” he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was smiling when he came back from taking the
call. “It was Pop,” he explained. “Dad phoned and gave
him the information from the Motor Vehicle Bureau.”
He handed Sam Morris a scrap of paper with a name
and a New York City address written on it. “This is the
man you were asking us about—the one who left without
the change from his twenty-dollar bill.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam’s eyes widened. “How did you learn who he
was?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys explained, and Sam shook his head in admiration.
“Such a smart idea. Now I can send Mr. Barrack
his money.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Maybe you ought to write him first and make sure
it’s the right person,” Sandy said. “Maybe the man you
want was just sitting in a car that belongs to somebody
else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam looked worried. “Do you think that’s likely?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll tell you what, Sam.” Ken spoke up. “We’re going
to be in New York tomorrow and we’ll check on it for
you. Dad’s apartment is right near this address. It won’t
be any trouble. Then you can be sure you’re sending
the money to the right man.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sam had to be persuaded. He insisted the boys had
already gone to enough trouble, by learning the name
and address.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If he has a phone we’ll just call him up,” Ken
pointed out. “And even if he doesn’t it will only take a
few minutes to run over there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, if you’re sure—” Sam said finally.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>“Fine,” Ken interrupted. “We’ll let you know what
we find out. And thanks for checking the box for us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy waited until they were outside the store and
then he spoke. “I don’t suppose you have any ulterior
motive in offering to get in touch with—what’s his
name?—with this Barrack fellow?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken grinned. “You have a low suspicious mind.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s not nearly as suspicious as yours,” Sandy retorted.
“You have no reason to believe that box is valuable.
And Sam didn’t exactly support your idea of the
thing having been switched—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He didn’t say he was <i>sure</i> it was the same box,” Ken
interrupted. “And I still think it’s possible that Dad
brought home a valuable antique, and that somebody
stole it and left in its place a worthless modern copy—the
one we’ve got now. But don’t worry. I’ve thought
of a way to check up on that theory. We’ll take the box
in to Felix Lausch at the Metropolitan Museum and ask
his advice.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s an idea.” Sandy’s eye lit up at the thought of
the art expert who was Richard Holt’s friend and who
would, both boys knew, give them any aid he could.
“If Lausch says this is an old box, but not worth very
much, then we’ll write the whole thing off as a bad
dream. Right?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Fair enough,” Ken agreed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Before they left for New York, some time before
noon, they wrote a note to Mom and left it on the
kitchen table.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’re borrowing your new jewel box so we can
show it to Mr. Lausch,” it read. “Hope you won’t mind.
We’ll take good care of it.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>Sandy stared at the note dubiously as they departed.
“She’ll mind, all right,” he said. “Mom likes to own
antiques, and she even brags about ’em once in a while.
But she’ll think we’re crazy to take one all the way to
New York to show to an expert.” He shrugged. “Well,
come on. But I’m going to tell her it was all your idea,
when she starts lighting into us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>By two o’clock that afternoon they were climbing the
stairs to the Holt apartment on Seventieth Street. There
was a scrawl in Ken’s father’s handwriting propped
against the phone. “Call me at Global when you get
in,” it read.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken dialed the number and talked briefly to his father,
completing arrangements for meeting him later on.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’re eating at Dominick’s,” he reported to Sandy.
“And Dad says he’s already called Dominick and
warned him, so we ought to be prepared for something
special.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy beamed. “Swell. That sounds like spaghetti.
How long have we got to work up an appetite?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Until six thirty.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I could do it in half that time,” Sandy said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken ignored him. He was leafing through the New
York telephone book. “Barnes ... Barotti ... and
here’s a Barrack, Charles. But no Amos Barrack. Guess
our friend with the broken watch crystal doesn’t have
a telephone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Maybe it’s unlisted—like your dad’s,” Sandy suggested.
“I tell you what. Call information and ask her if
there’s any phone at all at his address. If it’s an apartment
house there might be one in the lobby.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>“That’s a good idea. Then we could at least leave a
message for him.” Ken twirled the dial, made his request,
and a moment later was scribbling down the
number he had been given.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Only one phone at that address, listed under the
name of Marie Mallory,” he reported, as he began to
dial again. “I’ll try it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The ringing was answered shortly by a woman who
spoke so loudly that Ken had to jerk the receiver away
from his ear to avoid being deafened.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is there a Mr. Barrack there?” he asked. “A Mr.
Amos Barrack. I’d like to speak to him if it’s possible.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s not here now,” the woman bellowed. “He
works. He’ll be home tonight, I guess. He’s got a room
here. I’m the landlady. Any message?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My name is Holt,” Ken answered. “I’m calling Mr.
Barrack about something he left in Brentwood the
other day.... That’s right. Brentwood. Would you
tell him that, please, and ask him to call me this
evening?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure. I’ll tell him. What time?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Eh—let’s see.” Ken calculated quickly. “I won’t be
here until after eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right. I’ll tell him,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken gave her his father’s number and then hung up,
holding his hand to his long-suffering ear. “She said—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I heard her,” Sandy assured him. “And now let’s go
see Lausch and get that off our minds, so I can start
concentrating on spaghetti.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Felix Lausch declared that he was delighted to see
them. He inquired for his friend, Richard Holt, insisted
upon showing them one or two of his department’s
newest acquisitions, and then took them into his private
office and settled them comfortably.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>“Now,” he said, leaning back in his chair, “what can
I do for you? You’re not involved in another one of
those investigations you two seem to get into, are you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken grinned. “Sandy says we’re not. But I’m wondering
if you could tell us anything about this box?” He
unwrapped it and put it on Lausch’s desk.</p>

<p class='c015'>The round-faced little man bent forward to look at
it. “Just what did you want to know?” he asked. “This
is not in my line, you understand—even though it does
look Italian to me. But Italian paintings are a big
enough field for one man. I am an amateur in all other
aspects of Italian art.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’d like to know if it’s really an antique,” Ken explained,
“and if it’s valuable. We’d also like to know if
there’s any reason to think it might have been stolen
recently—from some European collection, that is. Probably
in Italy.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Lausch’s stubby finger traced the scrollwork on the
lid of the box. “I could make a guess at the answers to
your first two questions, but that’s all it would be. I
think you would rather have the opinion of an expert.”
He picked up his phone and asked for a number. “Sintelli
is a dealer in Italian antiques,” he explained. “He
should be able to help. As for your last question, I can
only say I’ve seen no notice of the theft of any such box
as this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He waited an instant and then he was saying, “Sintelli?... Lausch
here. Tony, I’ve got a question for
you—three questions, in fact. I’ve got what appears to
be an old Italian box— ... What?... No, a small
box. Iron, with a lead lining. I want to know if it’s old,
if it’s valuable, and if it might have been stolen recently
from some European collection—public or private....
Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>He looked up at the boys. “Can you leave it here?
Sintelli will pick it up and return it in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy hesitated only a moment. “Sure. But he won’t
hurt it, will he?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Lausch smiled. “It would be too bad if we experts
had to ruin everything we examined. No, it will be
quite safe.” He spoke into the phone again briefly and
then hung up. “Tony will drop it off here tomorrow
about ten, on his way to his shop. So I’ll have a report
for you any time after that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They were halfway to the door a few minutes later,
on the way out, when Ken turned back. “There’s just
one other thing. Suppose I wanted to have an exact
copy of that box made. Could it be done?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Lausch shrugged. “There are craftsmen good enough
to copy anything, I suppose, if one knows where to
find them. It would probably be an expensive job, however.
But I’ll check that with Sintelli too. He’ll know.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Over the red-checkered tablecloth at Dominick’s that
night Ken told his father about the inquiries they had
set in motion about the iron box. Mr. Holt looked
slightly amused, but just as he was about to comment,
at the end of Ken’s recital, he glanced at his watch.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come on!” he said, leaping up. “The first match begins
in a few minutes. We’re going to have to leave
before they’re over, anyway, if I’m going to catch my
Washington plane. So let’s not miss the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The wrestling matches were particularly exciting.
Conversation, as the boys and Richard Holt watched
them, was limited to shouts of encouragement and
howls of dismay. And Ken’s father made no reference
to the box as they drove him out to the airport.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>But as he got out of the car there, with a minute or
two to spare, he turned back for a final word.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m not going to tell you to drop this iron box mystery
you’ve cooked up,” he told Ken. “That wouldn’t do
any good.” He grinned at his son. “But I think Sandy’s
reasoning is sound. If the box is valuable—if it’s been
stolen, say—I’d never have been allowed to bring it
through customs. And if it isn’t, why go through any
hanky-panky about it, as the British say?” He took his
brief case off the seat and slipped it under his arm. “In
any case, take it easy. I’ll be back the day after tomorrow.
You’ll be in Brentwood then?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Probably, Dad,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But we’re not going back until we’ve used the basketball
tickets you’ve left us for tomorrow night,”
Sandy added.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Have a good time.” Holt raised his arm in a farewell
salute and disappeared through the doors of the terminal
building just as the loud-speaker announced the
ten-thirty flight to Washington.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was a few minutes past eleven when the boys let
themselves into Holt’s apartment.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hope we haven’t missed Barrack,” Ken muttered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t worry. He’d try again if he didn’t get us the
first time. He must have remembered by now what it
was he left in Brentwood. I don’t suppose there’s anything
in the refrigerator, is there?” Sandy added
thoughtfully as he hung up his coat.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Probably not,” Ken agreed. “When Dad’s only at
home for a day or two he—”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>But Sandy had already opened the refrigerator and
the expression on his face made it unnecessary for Ken
to look inside.</p>

<p class='c015'>A note pasted to the inner side of the door read, “I
figured you’d be hungry before bedtime.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Cold ham,” Sandy was chanting, “cheese, milk,
oranges....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And there’s bread and a pie in the breadbox,” Ken
added, peering under the lid.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy rubbed his hands. “Well, what’ll we have for
our first course? How about—?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The sharp sound of the buzzer cut him off. The boys
looked at each other in surprise, and Ken shrugged as
he walked into the hall to press the button that released
the lock on the downstairs door. Sandy was behind him
as he opened the apartment door and thrust his head
into the hall to listen. They heard the lower door shut,
and then the sound of mounting footsteps.</p>

<p class='c015'>A moment later a slender, neatly dressed man about
thirty-five years old rounded the last bend in the stairs
and came into view. He smiled at them as he came up
the last few steps.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Holt?” he inquired politely, looking from Sandy to
Ken.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m Ken Holt.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m Amos Barrack,” the stranger said. “My landlady
told me you phoned about something I left in Brentwood.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was trying to collect his scattered wits. “But
you’re not the man we thought you’d be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack smiled. “And I don’t know what I left in
Brentwood. Nothing, so far as I know. I thought maybe
I’d better drop by and get it straightened out tonight.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>The boys stepped back from the doorway.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come on in,” Ken said, and closed the door behind
their visitor when he had stepped into the foyer. “Sit
down, won’t you?” He led the way to the living room.
“We seem to have caused you some unnecessary trouble,”
he added, as Barrack settled himself somewhat
tentatively on the nearest chair. “But we were trying
to do you a favor.” He smiled.</p>

<p class='c015'>“A favor?” Barrack sounded more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken glanced at Sandy to see if he wanted to explain,
but Sandy’s expression told him that this was his
problem.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s this way,” Ken began. “The day before Christmas
a man stopped in at Sam Morris’s jewelry store in
Brentwood—that’s where we live—to have his watch
crystal replaced. When he returned to pick it up he
paid Morris with a twenty-dollar bill. But just at that
moment a small fire broke out in the store. Just a little
blaze in a wastebasket. When the excitement died
down and Morris looked around for his customer a few
minutes later, to give him his change, the man had disappeared.
Morris was worried about it, and eager to
find the man and give him his money. So—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But what made you call <i>me</i>?” Barrack interrupted.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken explained, briefly, about the picture Sandy had
taken and how they had traced the car’s license number.
“But, of course,” he concluded, “if you’ve never
been in Brentwood we must have made a mistake somehow.
Maybe we didn’t read the license number correctly.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>“But I was there that same day,” Barrack corrected
him apologetically. “I should have explained that. And
my car was parked opposite a jewelry store—right at
the time the fire happened, as a matter of fact. But I
didn’t go inside the store at all. And I can’t understand—”</p>

<p class='c015'>He broke off suddenly and his puzzled look gave way
to a smile. “It must have been my passenger,” Barrack
explained. “I’d forgotten all about him until this minute.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken and Sandy both smiled too.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good,” Ken said. “Then if you know who it was—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack shook his head. “But I don’t. I guess it’s my
turn to explain. I’m a salesman for the Tobacco Mart—a
company that sells smokers’ supplies. I was on my
way back from a trip through the Pennsylvania territory
that day, and one of my customers in some little
Pennsylvania town asked me if I could take a passenger
to New York. A friend of his, I guess. He didn’t want
to have to take the local into Philadelphia, and then another
train on from there. It’s a long trip that way. I
agreed, of course, and the fellow came along. I thought
he stayed in the car while I stopped to make a call in
Brentwood—I cover New Jersey too—but for all I
know he might have broken his watch then and gone
across the street to have it fixed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And you don’t know who he was?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Haven’t the slightest idea.” Barrack looked regretful
and then he brightened. “My Pennsylvania customer
would probably know, though. I could ask him the next
time I go by there and then let you know.” He got to
his feet.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>“Thanks,” Ken said. “We’d appreciate that—or,
rather, Sam Morris would. He doesn’t like to owe people
money.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But probably the fellow will write to the jeweler
and ask for his change before long,” Barrack pointed
out.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Probably,” Ken agreed. “Anyway we’re sorry to
have bothered you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No bother at all,” Barrack assured him. “I was kind
of puzzled. Thought I’d stop in and find out what it
was all about.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Their good-nights were brief but polite. But the door
had scarcely closed behind Barrack when Sandy
grabbed Ken’s arm.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We could ask him the name of his customer,” he
said, “and call the man up.” He reached for the doorknob.
“Why didn’t we think of that while—?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s hand found the doorknob first and held it.
“Don’t bother,” he said. “There’s no use trying to get
any honest information out of that gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Huh?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken locked the door and slipped the safety chain
into place. “I didn’t think of this myself until he was
giving his little spiel about his passenger, but this
phone here is unlisted. Dad’s name isn’t in the phone
book.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy stared at him. “What’s your father’s phone got
to do with Mr. Barrack—or anything else?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But the phone number is all I left with Barrack’s
landlady. I didn’t give her this address.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh,” Sandy said. “I see. And he couldn’t have got
the address by asking the phone company for it, because
they don’t give out that information.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>“Right,” Ken told him. “At least they don’t give it to
anybody but the police. And Barrack’s no policeman.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then how <i>did</i> he know how to find us,” Sandy
asked, “without telephoning first?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Probably,” Ken said slowly, “because he’d been here
before—looking for the box.”</p>

    <div>AN EXPLODED THEORY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Sandy repeated Ken’s last words in a sort of daze. “He’d
been here before looking for the box?” He shook his
head to clear it. “You mean the night your father got
back? When the door was found open in the morning?
You think Barrack was here then?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken nodded. “Barrack or somebody involved with
him. How else would he have known this address?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy shrugged. “He might have learned it in a hundred
different ways. But suppose for a minute you’re
right. In that case why would he come back here now?
Why wouldn’t he avoid us?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He probably wanted to find out how much we know—or
suspect,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” Sandy told him grimly, “you may suspect
plenty. But even you don’t <i>know</i> anything.” He started
briskly across the room. “He looked perfectly all right
to me.” He picked up the phone book and leafed
through it. “Here it is—the Tobacco Mart. So that part
of his story wasn’t invented, at least. It’s on Chatham
Square. That’s down at the edge of Chinatown,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>“That’s right,” Ken agreed. “And he may even work
there. Or, if he doesn’t, he’s made some arrangement for
the company to vouch for him if anybody should make
inquiries.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That what you’re planning to do?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken considered the question seriously. “I don’t know
at the moment.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy grinned. “But don’t tell me you’re not planning
to do anything. That would be too good to be true.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken looked at him for a moment and then he grinned
back. “You don’t sound as convincing as you think you
do. If I didn’t think up a plan of action, you would—and
you know it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy bristled for a moment and then gave it up.
“O.K.,” he said. “I admit I’m curious about the whole
business. And if Lausch has some interesting news for
us in the morning—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But that won’t be until ten o’clock,” Ken pointed
out. He walked toward the kitchen, with Sandy at his
heels, and opened the refrigerator door. “And in the
meantime,” Ken went on, putting milk and bread and
ham and cheese on the table, and beginning to cut
bread for sandwiches, “I’d like to keep an eye on Barrack’s
rooming house in the morning when it’s time for
him to leave for work. Maybe he’ll go down to the
Tobacco Mart. Maybe he won’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Maybe he’ll start right out on his sales route.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Anything’s possible,” Ken agreed. “I just want to be
there to see.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>It was more than cold at six thirty the next morning
when Ken hurried Sandy out of the apartment and
along quiet gray streets toward Barrack’s address. It
was bitter. Ken had pointed out that Sandy ought to
wear a hat, to hide his all-too-obvious red hair, and for
once Sandy had raised no objections. But he had complained
loudly when Ken insisted that they both put
on sunglasses, to further conceal their identity.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you don’t think dark glasses will look crazy, in
the dead of winter—” Sandy began.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’re a protection against snow blindness,” Ken
told him. “Go on. Put them on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They walked quickly, their chins buried in their coat
collars, until they reached the corner of Barrack’s block.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You stay here and I’ll go up to the next corner,” Ken
suggested. “That way we’ll be able to pick him up
whichever way he turns when he comes out of the
house.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right. But if he doesn’t come out soon I’ll be
picking up double pneumonia instead,” Sandy warned.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ll both follow him, but not too close together,”
Ken went on. “And if one of us should lose him—if we
should get separated—we’ll meet at the museum at ten
o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The icy minutes dragged slowly by. But actually it
was barely seven o’clock when Ken caught sight of
Barrack. The man was dressed this time in a battered
hat and well-worn overcoat, and he was walking briskly
toward the corner where Ken stood.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken could see that Sandy had already left his own
post and was coming along behind Barrack. Ken
stepped hastily inside a convenient hallway.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>He waited there until Barrack passed by, and then
sauntered slowly in the man’s wake, giving Sandy a
chance to pass him.</p>

<p class='c015'>As Sandy went by, Ken said quietly, “I’ll be behind
you. Looks like he’s heading for the Seventy-second
Street subway station.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Check.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s prophecy was accurate. They boys took up
positions on the station platform on either side of Barrack
to make sure he didn’t leave by another entrance,
and only moved in toward their quarry when a train
slowed to a stop before them. They watched him board
a car by its center door and then, screened by other
riders, they entered the same car by the doors at either
end.</p>

<p class='c015'>The train was an express, and it rocketed its way
downtown without a stop until it reached Times
Square. Barrack didn’t even look up as the train stood
in the station there. He was engrossed in a newspaper.</p>

<p class='c015'>But at Thirty-fourth Street, the next stop, he made
his way hurriedly out of the car. When he reached the
street the boys were both fairly close behind him, and
Ken cautiously dropped back another twenty feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack walked west on Thirty-fourth Street at a
rapid pace until he turned abruptly and entered a cafeteria.
Sandy waited on the sidewalk until Ken came up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do we go in?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Better not. You stand inside this doorway here, and
I’ll take the one beyond the cafeteria.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy glanced longingly toward the warm steamy
interior, but he didn’t argue.</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack was out again in less than fifteen minutes, to
continue his rapid pace westward. Sandy moved out
into the stream of pedestrians in his wake, and Ken fell
into position behind him.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>Barrack turned south when he reached Eighth Avenue
and walked along that busy truck-crowded street
until he had passed the rear of Pennsylvania Station.
At Thirty-second Street he swung westward again, to
walk briskly past the block-long bulk of New York’s
main post office.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were fewer people abroad in that neighborhood.
The boys could fall farther behind and still keep
their quarry in sight. At Ninth Avenue, Barrack waited
for a traffic light and then hurried past the halted vehicles.
A moment later he vanished from sight through
the doorway of a huge building.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy waited for Ken to catch up, and they stood for
a moment on the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Either he’ll come right out again, or he’ll take an
elevator,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the second hand on Ken’s new chronometer
had ticked off two full minutes, they drifted into the
lobby with the stream of workers obviously hurrying
toward an eight-o’clock deadline. The four elevators
along one wall each swallowed up a dozen or more
with every ascent. Ken and Sandy glanced around, saw
no sign of Barrack, and slid through the crowd to study
the building directory on the rear wall.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was obvious from the names listed on it that the
entire building was devoted to printers, paper dealers,
and ink companies.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s funny,” Sandy said. “What would he be doing
at a printing trade center? I guess you were right
after all. He <i>was</i> lying about where he worked.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>“I didn’t say that,” Ken reminded him. “And an employee
of the Tobacco Mart might have perfectly legitimate
business in a place like this. Maybe he came to
pick up a batch of labels or printed containers.” He
glanced at his watch. “Let’s wait outside awhile and
see if he comes back down and goes some place else—to
Chatham Square, say.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They found a sheltered doorway a few yards down
the block and did their best to keep warm by stamping
their feet. But the icy chill crept through their overcoats
and into their very bones.</p>

<p class='c015'>At nine o’clock Sandy said grimly, “I’ve had enough
of this. I’ll agree to anything. Barrack lied about the
Tobacco Mart. He’s really a printer. Or he’s an international
crook who steals rubies to melt down into red
ink which he ships around in iron boxes. Have it any
way you like. But if I don’t get some hot coffee pretty
soon—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right,” Ken interrupted, to Sandy’s amazement.
“This doesn’t seem to be getting us anywhere. I’ll agree
to leaving here now—after all, we have to get up to
the museum, anyway—if you’ll agree to coming back
here about noon. Then, if Barrack does work here, we
ought to be able to pick him up again. Maybe—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I told you I’d agree to anything,” Sandy said, starting
toward a lunchroom sign he had spotted a block
away. “Anyway, by noon we’ll have the information
from Lausch and maybe you’ll be willing to call this
whole thing off. This is supposed to be our Christmas
vacation, remember? I—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll feel better when you’ve had some breakfast,”
Ken assured him.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>They did feel considerably better, although Sandy
was still mumbling dire forebodings about frostbite in
both feet, when Lausch opened his office door to them
an hour later.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good!” The little art expert beamed. “Sintelli has
just sent back your box, and the answers to all your
questions. But come in. Come in and sit down near the
heater. You must be cold if you have walked here from
my friend Holt’s apartment.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hah!” Sandy said under his breath. “If that’s all
we’d done—!” But at a glare from Ken he broke off and
moved toward the chairs Lausch was pulling into place
for them.</p>

<p class='c015'>“First,” Lausch said a moment later, smoothing out
a sheet of notes on his desk, “you wanted to know if
the box is really old.” He smiled at them over his
glasses. “It is—definitely. Sintelli didn’t make any spectroscopic
tests of the metal, but he said that wasn’t
necessary. He is quite certain that the box was made
not less than three hundred years ago.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken gulped. He was aware of a convulsive movement
on Sandy’s part—the beginning of a vast guffaw that
Sandy nobly controlled.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I see.” Ken gulped once more, and turned his head
to avoid Sandy’s glance. “What else?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You wanted to know if the box is valuable,” Lausch
went on. “And in this case,” he said, cheerfully unaware
of Ken’s reaction to his first statement, “I’m afraid
you will find the news not so pleasant. Sintelli says this
box is in excellent condition, but that even so it is not
worth more than fifteen or twenty dollars in American
money.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>“Is that all?” Ken’s voice cracked on the words.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Unfortunately yes.” Lausch nodded. “So many of
them were made at the time, you see, to be used—apparently—as
small money boxes. They can be found in
numerous antique shops.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very interesting. Ve-ry interesting,” Sandy said in a
curious choked voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sintelli was quite surprised at your third question,”
Lausch went on. “He doesn’t know why you thought
such a box as this might have been stolen from a museum
or anywhere else. They’re not valuable or rare
enough to merit inclusion in a collection—or to merit
the risk of stealing, for that matter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ken will have to refer to his crystal ball for an explanation
of that,” Sandy murmured.</p>

<p class='c015'>Lausch glanced at him questioningly. “I didn’t quite
understand you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nothing—nothing,” Sandy said hastily. “Let’s see.
There was one further question, wasn’t there?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” Lausch referred to his notes once more. “Could
such a box be duplicated, you wanted to know. Sintelli
doesn’t know why any craftsman would attempt it. As
I said, the boxes themselves are readily available and inexpensive.
And, besides, their only charm lies in the
fact that, being handmade, no two were exactly alike.
An exact duplication would seem pointless. And a modern
craftsman would probably charge more to make
such a thing than you would pay for an original box.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But it could be duplicated—if there was any reason
for doing such a thing?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken knew that Sandy’s persistence was deliberate.
He was turning the knife in the wound, paying Ken
back for that long vigil in the cold that morning.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>“Quite easily, of course,” Lausch answered seriously.
“Even the imperfections—the tiny roughnesses in the
design, owing to the poor tools of the period—could be
perfectly reproduced by means of a plaster cast. It
would take a little ingenuity, perhaps, and patience.
But it would be by no means impossible or even very
difficult.” He leaned back in his chair. “Does that satisfy
you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy, obviously enjoying himself, answered him.
“Oh, perfectly,” he said. “It all fits in perfectly with a
little old theory Ken had whipped up.” He dropped a
heavy hand on Ken’s shoulder in mock congratulation.
“Doesn’t it, Ken, old boy?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>“Must handle this with great care,” Sandy said a little
later as the boys let themselves into the Holt apartment.
He deposited Mom’s jewel box on a table and patted it
gently. “Valuable antique—very valuable. Worth almost
a dime a dozen. Unless, of course,” he added,
cocking his head on one side and studying the box intently,
“it is instead an ingenious copy of a valuable
antique, made by some nefarious criminal.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Go right ahead. Enjoy yourself,” Ken told him,
slumping into a chair without bothering to remove his
overcoat.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy swung around to grin at him. “You can’t
blame me, can you? When a mastermind like yourself
gets really tangled up in his own theories—when he is
knocked out by the weight of his own genius—Now
where are you going?” he demanded as Ken got up
and started toward the boys’ bedroom in the rear of the
apartment. Sandy followed him.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>“It doesn’t concern you,” Ken told him. “And it’s got
nothing to do with the box.” He began to change into
a pair of tweed slacks and a flannel shirt. “I was obviously
way off the beam about that. You were probably
mistaken about the weight of it the first time, and
if we accept that, then there’s no reason to think there’s
anything fishy about the box at all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You haven’t answered my question.” Sandy, entirely
serious now, sat down on the edge of the bed. “What’s
the idea of changing your clothes? Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c015'>For a moment Ken didn’t answer. And then he said
reluctantly, “Well, this will give you another laugh.
But I’m going down to that building where we left
Barrack this morning. I’m still curious about him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I see,” Sandy said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you?” Ken smiled briefly. “Well, that’s more
than I do. But somehow I—” He broke off and pulled a
heavy sweater on over his shirt.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy took off the jacket of his suit and began to
unbutton his shirt.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was Ken’s turn to ask a question. “What’re you
changing your clothes for?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy looked surprised. “For the same reason you are.
So we’ll look a little different from the way we did this
morning—just to be on the safe side.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t be a dope,” Ken told him. “You don’t have to
come along. This is my hunch. And it’s my—” He
stopped.</p>

<p class='c015'>“‘And it’s my father.’ That’s what you were going to
say. Weren’t you?” Sandy demanded. “You don’t like
the idea of Barrack knowing his address, and I don’t
either. Especially after that mysterious open door here
the other night. I agree with you. It’s probably got
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>nothing to do with the box. But don’t tell me it’s got
nothing to do with <i>me</i>—if there’s any chance that
somebody’s interested in making trouble for Richard
Holt.”</p>

<p class='c015'>For a moment neither of them spoke. Sandy busied
himself getting dressed. But Ken knew that Sandy too
was remembering the occasion when Richard Holt’s
nose for news had brought him into serious danger,
when he had learned more than was safe for him to
know about certain criminal activities. Ken had no
real reason to suspect that Barrack was a criminal, or
that Barrack’s knowledge of his father’s address was
actually incriminating evidence. But Ken also knew
that he himself wouldn’t be satisfied until he learned a
little more about the affable Mr. Barrack.</p>

<p class='c015'>And Sandy’s reaction didn’t surprise him. Once Ken
had let Sandy see that he was really worried, his red-headed
friend would naturally insist upon standing by.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken made one more effort to keep Sandy out of
what he believed to be his own problem.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re going to give me a guilt complex,” he said.
“If you get frostbite, standing—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Frostbite?” Sandy sounded amazed. “In these shoes?”
He looked down at the heavy brogues he was putting
on. “What are you trying to do? Give me a guilt complex?
I agreed when we left that place this morning
that I’d go back with you this noon, didn’t I? Do you
want me to go skulking around in corners for the rest
of my life because I broke a promise?” He stood up.
“Are you ready?”</p>

<p class='c015'>For a moment their eyes met and they both grinned.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” Ken said then. “I’m ready.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>The boys reached the building on Ninth Avenue a
few minutes before twelve o’clock, just as the first
trickle of workers began to emerge on their way to
lunch. From a lobby across the street they watched the
trickle swell to a steady stream.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy leaned comfortably against a radiator. “Why
didn’t we find this spot this morning?” he asked. “This
is my idea of comfortable sleuthing. When—” He came
swiftly erect. “There he is! Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack was just coming through the doorway, carrying
half a dozen small cartons. He paused at a large
mailbox designed for packages, standing against the
building wall, and began to drop the cartons in, one
after the other. The largest proved too big for the opening,
and Barrack propped it on top of the mailbox instead.
Then, with one package still tucked securely
under his arm, he walked the few steps to the corner,
and waited for a light. He apparently intended to walk
eastward on Thirty-second Street.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You take him,” Ken said. “I’ll be along in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He dashed across the street, between rumbling trucks,
and took a swift look at the package Barrack had left
outside the box. Then he turned and crossed Ninth
Avenue again, in plenty of time to fall in a few steps
behind Sandy. Barrack was walking swiftly eastward.
Ken whistled a few bars of “Yankee Doodle,” quietly, to
let Sandy know he had caught up. Sandy replied with
an answering whistle.</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack was following the same route he had taken
that morning, in reverse. As he neared the cafeteria
where he had stopped for breakfast, Ken gave a start.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>Up ahead, apparently waiting for someone at the
cafeteria entrance, stood the man whose broken watch
crystal Sam Morris had repaired on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p class='c015'>In almost that same instant Ken saw Sandy sidestep
into a shop doorway. He waited there until Ken came
up.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken stopped and pretended to stare through the glass
at a display of hardware and tools, while he continued
to watch Barrack.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You see what I see?” Sandy said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken nodded.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It sure is a small world,” Sandy muttered. “And
brother, when you get a hunch, it is a hunch!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I certainly didn’t expect this,” Ken assured him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack had reached the cafeteria doorway. He entered
briskly through the revolving door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Funnier and funnier,” Sandy muttered. “Did you
see that? Barrack walked right past him!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken nodded. Barrack had certainly seen the man. He
had actually brushed against him as he entered. But
neither had given any sign of recognition.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And don’t tell me,” Sandy said, “that they couldn’t
recognize each other—not after they drove together for
a couple of hundred miles.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look,” Ken said. “Now Mr. Watch Crystal is going
inside too.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come on,” Sandy said.</p>

<p class='c015'>They began to move toward the cafeteria.</p>

<p class='c015'>A hasty glance through the wide plate-glass front of
the big self-service restaurant assured them that it was
very crowded.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think it’s safe to go in,” Ken muttered, “as long as
we’re careful to keep out of their way.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>“This is the first time I ever went into a restaurant
with my mind on something besides food,” Sandy said.
“Go ahead. I’ll follow you in a minute. We’ll be less
conspicuous that way. Meet you at the tray counter if
the coast is clear.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Inside the great brightly lighted room, rimmed with
service counters, hundreds of men and women were
milling around, intent on collecting a trayful of food or,
if already laden with trays, on finding a vacant table
where they could eat.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken stalled around at the tray counter, collecting an
unnecessary amount of knives, forks, and spoons, until
he caught Sandy’s eye on him. Then he moved on to
the water fountain. Sandy shortly joined him there with
his own tray and an assortment of cutlery.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Barrack’s at the sandwich counter. Watch Crystal is
standing in line in front of the hot table,” Ken murmured.</p>

<p class='c015'>They prolonged the task of filling their water glasses
until Barrack, with an almost empty tray, made his way
through the room to a table for six in a far corner. Two
chairs at the table had been tipped forward, to mark
the places as reserved. Barrack set his tray down in
front of one of them, righted the chair, and sat down.
He put the package he was carrying—it was about the
size of a small suit box—on the floor near his feet. Then
he began to eat his single sandwich, washing down the
mouthfuls with swallows of coffee.</p>

<p class='c015'>An irritated voice snarled at Ken’s elbow. “That’s the
sixth time you’ve rinsed out that water glass. You going
to stay here all day?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>Ken looked around into a pair of eyes as irritated
as the voice. “Sorry,” he muttered, and moved away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’d better get a sandwich ourselves,” Sandy suggested.
“We’ll be less noticeable doing that than hanging
around here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They made sure that neither Barrack nor the second
man looked their way as they hastily collected a pair of
corned beef sandwiches and two glasses of milk. Then
they sought out a table from which they could continue
their observations.</p>

<p class='c015'>They had just managed to find a satisfactory place
when Sam Morris’s former customer moved away from
the food counters. His tray was crowded. It was easy to
see why he had taken so long to collect his lunch.</p>

<p class='c015'>He made his way straight between the crowded tables
to the one where Barrack sat, lowered his tray to
the space in front of the second tipped-up chair, and
then sat down there. He didn’t look at Barrack as he
began to eat.</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack was almost finished by that time. He took
the last bite of his sandwich, swallowed the last of his
coffee, and stood up. Without looking back over his
shoulder he headed for the door.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy moved halfway out of his chair. “Should we
follow him? Or—” He glanced back at the table where
the second man was still eating. “Hey—look! Barrack
forgot his package.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know.” Ken’s voice was tense. “Watch.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Just as Ken spoke, the man at the table dropped his
napkin on the floor. Instead of reaching for a fresh one
from the dispenser in the middle of the table, he bent
down to pick it up. If the boys hadn’t been watching
him intently they would have missed what he did then.
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>As he picked up the napkin he also picked up the flat
package Barrack had left on the floor, put it on his
knees under his recovered napkin, and then went on
eating. But now he seemed suddenly in a hurry, gulping
his food in large mouthfuls.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Never mind Barrack,” Ken said. “Let’s see where he
goes.” He picked up the second half of his sandwich.
“I’ll finish this outside. You stay here until he leaves.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Right,” Sandy agreed. He still had the surprised
expression he had worn ever since the man first appeared
at the cafeteria entrance.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken waited in the doorway adjoining the cafeteria
until, a few minutes later, the man came out and moved
purposefully toward the corner. Sandy was close behind
him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Their quarry descended into the subway station at
the corner, and the boys followed. He boarded an uptown
train and they got into the next car, standing
where they could see him through the glass-topped
door between.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the train pulled into the Times Square station
the man got off and headed for the street. But before
he passed through the exit turnstile he suddenly reversed
his direction, walking straight back toward
them. Sandy froze where he was and, finding himself
before a chewing-gum slot machine, tried to look as if
he had been busy inserting pennies into it for some
time. Ken, who had been slightly farther behind, had
time to step behind a protective pillar.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the station was fairly well occupied. They didn’t
dare let the man get too far away before they followed
him. Sandy took up the chase.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>Ken intercepted him as he came past. “Let me take
the lead. He may have seen you. Drop behind.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In their new order, with Ken dogging the man’s footsteps
as closely as he thought was safe, they went
through the maze of corridors and passageways that
brought them to the crosstown shuttle-train terminal.
They boarded a train already waiting on the nearest
track and were whisked across Manhattan to the east
side. There the man made his way down a flight of
stairs to the station platform of a downtown subway.</p>

<p class='c015'>From where they stood, at the head of the stairs, the
boys could see him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’d better stay up here,” Ken said. “I’ll go down
on the platform. But try to get down in time to get on
the train he takes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A local train came into the station shortly after Ken
descended the stairs. His quarry ignored it, pacing up
and down with the package held tightly beneath his
arm. Suddenly the man made for the stairs he had just
come down.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken bounded after him, glad that Sandy was on
guard on the upper level. He saw the redhead first
when he reached the top and then, just beyond him, the
man they were both following.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy rounded a corner only a few yards behind the
men. Ken trailed him. But as he rounded the corner
himself he saw Sandy standing still, turning his head
frantically from side to side. The man was nowhere in
sight.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where’d he go?” Ken asked quickly, coming up beside
Sandy.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>“I don’t know.” Sandy spoke between clenched teeth.
“When I came around the corner—right behind him—he
was already gone. He could be anywhere.” His gesture
took in an exit to the street level, and three stairways
leading down to various train platforms.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken thought quickly. If the man had disappeared
that fast, he must have gone down the nearest stairway.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let’s try this,” he said, and dove for a flight of steps
that led to another section of the downtown subway
platform they had just left.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was an express train waiting in the station
when they reached the bottom of the stairs, but its
doors were already beginning to slide shut. A familiar
shape caught Ken’s eye. The man who had broken his
watch crystal—the man who had picked up Barrack’s
package—was squeezing himself through one rapidly
narrowing entrance.</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys dashed for another door in the same car.
Ken’s fingers grabbed for the rubber edge of the panel
in an effort to prevent it from closing. But he was too
late. It slid shut with a small final thud. The train
lurched into motion.</p>

<p class='c015'>One by one the cars went past, at a swiftly increasing
speed. And then the train disappeared entirely, except
for the winking red light on the last car, growing
smaller and smaller in the dark tunnel of the subway.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken let himself sag wearily against a pillar. “We
could start a school,” he said. “The Allen-Holt School
of How Not to Shadow a Suspect.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’re not licked yet. Come on.” Sandy took hold of
Ken’s arm with sudden vigor.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come where?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Just follow me. It’s my turn to have a hunch. But
hurry!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy dragged him quickly to the top of the stairway,
hesitated there a moment trying to orient himself
in the confused underground labyrinth beneath Grand
Central Station, and then demanded, “Which way is
Lexington Avenue?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Over that way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s the way we go then.” Sandy darted toward
the exit, and Ken followed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Like a broken-field runner Sandy ducked, pivoted,
and plunged through the crowd, with Ken always
close behind him, until they emerged into the street.
Just in front of them a taxicab was discharging a
baggage-laden passenger. Sandy crossed the sidewalk
in a single leap.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>“Come on!” he shouted to Ken. To the driver he said,
“Chatham Square—as fast as you can get there!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken barely managed to pull the door shut behind
himself as the taxi started off. He collapsed breathless
against the cushions.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where’s he taking us?” he asked, as soon as he
could speak.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy opened his mouth to answer, but the words
were pushed back down his throat as the driver swung
left, with wildly squealing brakes, an instant before the
green light blinked off.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wherever it is,” Ken gasped, “do we have to go in
this much of a hurry?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s Chatham Square,” Sandy answered. “And we
do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken blinked. “What makes you think—?” He didn’t
bother to finish the sentence. The cab driver was
sounding his horn so loudly, in impatience at a slow-moving
truck up ahead, that speech was useless.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the taxi finally rounded the truck and darted
forward into the clear, Sandy answered the uncompleted
question.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I told you it was a hunch,” he said. “But the Tobacco
Mart’s on Chatham Square, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken nodded. “So?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, Barrack said he worked there, but it looks
now as if he doesn’t.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken interrupted. “I haven’t had a chance to tell you
before, but the label on that package Barrack left on
top of the box said Spectrum Printing Company.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>“Then Barrack must have been lying about his job
with the Tobacco Mart. Why would he have been mailing
packages for a printing firm if he didn’t work
there?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“As a favor, maybe,” Ken suggested.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy ignored him. “I’m assuming, therefore, that
he does <i>not</i> work for the Tobacco Mart. But the fact
that he used its name must mean he knows the outfit—and
may be tied in with it somehow. And therefore our
friend Watch Crystal might also be tied in with it. Anyway,
my hunch is that that’s where he’s going. If I’m
wrong we haven’t lost anything, except the price of
the taxi fare.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You think then,” Ken said slowly, bracing his feet
on the floor as the cab tore around another corner to
head downtown, “that they definitely recognized each
other in the restaurant—that the exchange of the package
was a planned thing?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy stared at him. “What else could it have been?
Sure, Barrack might honestly have left a package behind
in a restaurant. And some stranger sitting near by
might have noticed it, and been dishonest enough to
pick it up and make off with it. Sure, it could all have
happened that way. But not to those two. Not after
Barrack admitted to us that he’d been with Watch
Crystal the other day. Besides, there was something
mighty smooth and furtive about the way that exchange
was made. If that whole deal wasn’t carefully planned
I’ll—I’ll—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You can’t eat your hat in this weather,” Ken said.
“It’s too cold. You’ll need it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The taxi driver, skillfully edging his way through the
traffic, spoke over his shoulder. “Any special number
on Chatham Square?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>“No,” Sandy told him. “Just drop us off when you get
there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A few minutes later the driver was saying, “O.K.
Drop off. You’re here—and fast, like you ordered.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Swell. Thanks.” Sandy added a tip to the fare registered
on the meter.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the taxi started back uptown the boys stood
uncertainly for a moment on the sidewalk. Chatham
Square was a junction point of several streets and alleys,
all radiating out from its open area like the spokes of a
crazily designed wheel. Evidence of New York’s large
Chinese population was everywhere.</p>

<p class='c015'>The window of the drugstore just behind them was
so covered with Chinese characters that no street number
was visible. A sign on the adjoining building announced—in
English—that tattooing was done on the
premises, next door was a Chinese grocery whose windows
were heaped high with strange items of food including
a variety of dried fish and meat. A few steps
beyond the grocery a blank wall was covered with
large sheets of paper bearing freshly inked Chinese
characters. Beneath them, in a cluster on the sidewalk,
stood several Chinese huddled in warm coats.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’re reading the news bulletins,” Ken murmured,
as Sandy stared. He let his eye wander farther
around the square until finally he saw a street number
on the front of a souvenir shop. “The Tobacco Mart
must be down that way,” Ken decided, gesturing toward
the right. “Let’s cross the square and try to sight
it from there.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>They dodged through the square’s congested traffic,
walked past a motion-picture theater whose lobby was
decorated with stills from Oriental pictures, and then
backtracked quickly into the protection of the theater’s
posters. They had found what they were looking for—a
weathered sign atop a dilapidated three-story building
on the other side of the street. The sign read TOBACCO
MART—<i>Smokers’ Supplies and Novelties</i>—<span class='fss'>WHOLESALE
ONLY</span>. The two upper floors of the building were pierced
by dusty blank-staring windows, the top ones dingily
curtained. The street floor was fronted by glass display
windows, but they had been painted black to a line
above eye level, so that the passer-by could see nothing
of what was beyond them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy shifted his weight nervously from one foot to
the other. “Well, there it is,” he said unnecessarily.
“Now all we have to do is see if my hunch—” He broke
off because Ken had grabbed his arm.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s Watch Crystal!” Ken said. “Coming around
the corner there! You were right!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Instinctively they backed farther into the theater
lobby as the man they watched hurried toward the entrance
of the Tobacco Mart. He paused a moment in
front of it and looked quickly around. His eyes, beneath
a lowered hatbrim, surveyed the front of the theater
opposite, and the upper stories of the buildings on
either side of it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken could feel his heart thudding heavily. He had
no idea whether they had been noticed or not.</p>

<p class='c015'>And then, as if satisfied, the man hurried through
the black-painted door of the wholesale tobacco shop.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>Ken took a deep breath. “Well,” he said, “you sure
outsmarted him! And I was ready to give up when he
disappeared back there at Grand Central Station. Do
you think he spotted us—that that’s why he was going
through all those evasion tactics?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t know. Maybe he has reasons of his own for
thinking that he’s always in danger of being tailed. We
can’t even guess about what’s going on here. We don’t
know enough. The question is,” Sandy added, “how to
go about learning any more. I suppose we could go into
the Tobacco Mart and inquire the price of cigars by the
thousand lot.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken shook his head. “No use tipping our hand—on
the chance that Watch Crystal hasn’t seen us yet.” He
glanced toward the cashier’s window and saw that the
ticket seller was already eying them with marked disapproval.
“But we can’t hang around here any longer.
Let’s see if we can’t find a better vantage point, where
we can keep an eye on the Tobacco Mart for a while.
Then if Watch Crystal comes out and goes somewhere
else—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Right,” Sandy agreed. “If we follow him long enough
we’re bound to get some clue as to what he’s up to.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They found what they were seeking almost immediately—an
observation post that seemed custom-made
for the job of watching the grimy store across the
square. It was a small branch library—one of the many
subdivisions of New York’s huge public library system.
It occupied a narrow building not more than twenty-five
feet wide, but it appeared to use all three floors of
the structure. In any case, as the boys could see through
a large window running almost the full width of the
building, the second floor was clearly a reading and
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>reference room. Several elderly men were seated there
at broad tables, reading by the gray light of the winter
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s for us,” Sandy agreed, when Ken suggested
that they go in. “I’ll keep an eye on the Tobacco Mart
until you get set up there, and then I’ll join you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken pushed through the heavy doors on the street
level and found himself in the library’s lending room.
There were long rows of stacks at the rear, and a charge
desk near the entrance presided over by a single librarian.
She looked up only briefly as Ken walked past
her to the flight of stairs mounting against one wall.</p>

<p class='c015'>The reading room on the second floor was larger than
it had seemed from the street, and entirely occupied by
heavy oak tables set parallel to each other down its
entire length. But the half-dozen readers—all men—were
clustered around the two tables nearest the front,
where the light was best. Ken took a newspaper from
the periodical rack as he went by, and sat down in one
of two adjoining vacant chairs at the front table. He
had only to look through the window, over the top of
his paper, to see the Tobacco Mart across the square.</p>

<p class='c015'>A few minutes later Sandy slid quietly into place
beside him, shaking his head to indicate that he had
seen nothing of interest while he kept guard below.</p>

<p class='c015'>The three shabbily dressed men who shared their
table glanced at them curiously, as if unaccustomed to
seeing strange faces in that room, and then returned to
their half-dozing perusal of magazines or newspapers.</p>

<p class='c015'>The minute hand on a large wall clock crept slowly
on its way. The big room was warm and quiet, shut off
from the traffic noises below. The creaking of Sandy’s
chair, as he shifted his weight on the hard seat, sounded
loud in the silence.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>At the end of half an hour the door of the Tobacco
Mart still remained closed. No one had left or entered
the shop.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy shrugged, got up to exchange the photographic
magazine he had been looking at for another one, and
sat down again.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another old man came in, glared at Ken as if he were
occupying his own favorite chair, and settled himself
noisily at the second table. His arrival was the only
event that broke the peaceful monotony of the second
half hour.</p>

<p class='c015'>Finally Sandy pulled an envelope out of his pocket,
and the stub of a pencil, and appeared to be making
notes from an article in his magazine. But he held the
envelope so that Ken could see what he had written.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What do you think really goes on over there?”
Sandy’s scrawl read. “Is the Tobacco Mart an innocent
place of business—or is it not? And if it is why did
Watch Crystal behave so mysteriously?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken shrugged his shoulders as a signal that he had no
answers to Sandy’s questions. They were the same questions
he had been asking himself. He tilted his head in
a gesture toward the street that asked, “Do you want to
leave? Shall we give this up?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy grinned and shook his head slightly. “Why?”
he scribbled on the envelope. “Always like to catch up
on my reading during vacation. And I’m not hungry
yet.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>By the end of the next hour several of the room’s
other occupants had departed. The square outside was
beginning to fill with the first early shadows of winter
darkness.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly Ken sat erect in his chair. An instant later
he was getting to his feet, motioning Sandy to follow.
But Sandy had already shut his magazine and stuffed
his envelope and pencil back into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c015'>They had both seen the boy who emerged from the
Tobacco Mart and started briskly down the street,
pushing a two-wheeled cart laden with packages.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Delivery boy,” Ken said, as the library door shut
behind them and they hurried along the sidewalk in the
same direction. “Maybe we can learn something from
him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The boy’s destination was not far away. It proved to
be—as Ken and Sandy had suspected—the nearest post
office. The place was crowded at that hour of the day.
The boy from the Tobacco Mart took his place at the
end of a lengthy line waiting in front of the parcel-post
window. The pile of packages he had brought with him
was heaped at his feet, so that he could shove them
along as the line moved up.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken got into place just behind him. “Quite a load
you’ve got there,” he said conversationally.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That?” The boy touched the pile of packages with
the toe of his shoe. His voice sounded contemptuous.
“That’s nothing. You should have seen what I had to
lug around in the old days.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Old days?” Ken repeated casually, as if he had no
other interest than idle talk to pass the time. “Business
better then?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>“The boss was better,” the boy corrected him. “Fellow
who used to own the business knew his stuff. But the
new owner—!” He shook his head in disgust. “Our line
is smokers’ supplies—tobacco and stuff, see? But sometimes
I think he doesn’t know the difference between
a good Havana cigar and a—a cigar-store Indian.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken laughed what he hoped sounded like a sympathetic
laugh. His mind was racing, busy with the interesting
news that the Tobacco Mart had a new owner—a
man who seemed to know nothing about tobacco.
Sandy, behind him, gave him a poke in the ribs to indicate
that he too had heard.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Too bad,” Ken said. “But I suppose it takes time to
learn a new business, if it’s been dumped in your lap
unexpectedly—if you inherit it or something.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He didn’t inherit this.” The boy moved his packages
ahead with a small angry kick. “He bought it. And
that’s what I can’t understand. Why? He doesn’t lay in
hardly any new stock. Sometimes he doesn’t even bother
to fill the orders that come in! So naturally not so many
are coming any more. And I’m telling you we used to
have orders from all over the country!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Before Ken could ask him a new question he went on
again. He seemed only too glad to talk to somebody
who was willing to listen to his complaints.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve been working there for three years,” he muttered,
“after school and on Saturdays and all. But believe
me, I’m thinking about quitting. At first I tried to
help the guy out—give him a right steer once in a
while when I saw he didn’t know anything. But would
he listen? Oh, no! According to him, he knows everything.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stubborn,” Ken suggested, his tone still sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>“Stubborn <i>and</i> dumb,” the boy added. “Finally I said
to him the other day, ‘Look, Mr. Grace, why don’t you
rent out the second floor now that you don’t need it for
supplies any more?’ It’s empty, see? And it could just
as well be rented, like the top floor is. But you know
what he says? ‘No, Pete,’ he says to me, ‘I like it this
way—quiet. Tenants right over my head might be
noisy.’ Can you beat that? I know he’s losing money on
the business. He can’t even be making expenses, the
way he runs things. And here he won’t even <i>try</i> to make
a little extra money!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sounds as if you could do a lot better for yourself
somewhere else,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And, brother, I’m going to! Why that—!” The boy
broke off as he suddenly became aware that he had
reached the head of the line.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken and Sandy stayed where they were, hoping for
further information about the mysterious new owner
of the Tobacco Mart. But the boy was busy, conscientiously
checking up on each package that he
pushed through the window.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the clerk handed him his change he said, “You’re
slipping, Pete. Used to ship out twice this amount—and
once a day instead of once a week.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re telling me!” the boy answered, with his sour
grin. “You should tell my genius boss—John D. Grace.
The D is for dopey.” He moved aside from the window.
“Be seeing you!” He included Ken in his farewell gesture.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good luck!” Ken called after him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Lift your parcels up here, please,” the clerk said
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>Ken stared at him blankly. “Oh—eh—I just wanted
some stamps, please. Two threes and—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Buddy,” the clerk said, “can’t you read? That sign
in front of you says parcel post. If you want stamps—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, sorry. Thanks.” Ken departed hastily, with
Sandy close behind him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Out on the sidewalk again they headed instinctively
back toward the Tobacco Mart. Pete, the delivery boy,
was only half a block ahead of them, whistling dismally
as he pushed his truck along the uneven sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very interesting,” Sandy murmured.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very interesting indeed,” Ken agreed. “Do you suppose
Grace is our friend Watch Crystal? Do you
think—?”</p>

<p class='c015'>He let the question die away. They had turned the
corner into the block where the Tobacco Mart stood.
The man they called Watch Crystal was visible at its
door, peering impatiently out and down the street.
When he saw Pete approaching he called to him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hurry up! This is a rush order!” He was waving a
small package, about the size of two cartons of cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c015'>“O.K. I’m coming, Mr. Grace.” There was more surprise
than anything else in the boy’s voice. “Somebody
must want a smoke awful bad,” he added as he drew
near his employer.</p>

<p class='c015'>Grace ignored his attempt at humor. “Take a taxi,”
he ordered. “And take one back here. You’ll be bringing
another package with you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Somebody returning their old cigar stubs?” Pete
asked.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>Grace snapped at him. “I don’t pay you to ask idiotic
questions. Get going! The address is on the package.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, sir, Mr. Grace.” Pete turned away, his eyes already
ranging the busy square for a vacant taxi.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s one for us!” Sandy had sighted a cab that
was just swinging around the corner behind him. He
made a dive for it and Ken rushed after him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Just pull over to the curb and wait a minute,” Sandy
directed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken strained his eyes in the growing dusk to keep
Pete in sight. The boy was walking slowly on down the
sidewalk, waving his arm occasionally when he thought
he saw a taxi approaching.</p>

<p class='c015'>The driver of the boys’ car turned around in his seat,
his eyes curious. “Playing games?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Playing games,” Sandy agreed.</p>

<p class='c015'>The driver shrugged. “It’s all right with me. It’s
your dough that’s ticking away on the clock.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right,” Ken said a moment later. Pete had found
a cab and climbed in. “Follow that taxi there.” He
pointed it out.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ten minutes later the boys found themselves far
downtown, less than a block from the East River. From
inside their parked cab they could see Pete, half a
block ahead, getting out of his cab and entering a small
cigar store. The boy’s taxi remained at the curb. In
almost no time Pete reappeared, clutching a package
about half the size of the one he had delivered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Back to the Tobacco Mart?” Sandy asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken thought quickly. Pete’s taxi was already rolling
off. “Let’s not. We seem to be following a chain—first
Barrack, then Grace, then Pete—and now this. Let’s
see what ‘this’ is.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>“Good idea. How much?” Sandy asked their driver.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was grinning as he joined Ken on the sidewalk a
moment later. “Sounded to me as if the driver said, ‘So
long, Junior G-men.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” Ken said, “maybe the laugh will turn out to
be on us after all. But so long as we can pick up new
links in the chain we might as well keep going.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That reminds me.” Sandy spoke through chattering
teeth. “Link sausage makes a fine meal.” But he moved
steadily along beside Ken toward the little shop up
ahead.</p>

<p class='c015'>They approached it warily, but when they got close
they saw that its windows were so steamed up that
they were no longer transparent.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s teeth were chattering, too. “Maybe we could go
right in,” he said. “At least it would be warm. And nobody
in there would be likely to recognize us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The wind from the river cut like ice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s an idea,” Sandy said. “Maybe they sell chocolate.
Though right now I think I could even eat chewing
tobacco.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly a shadow appeared against the steamy glass
of the shop’s door. The boys swung around and walked
quickly into the entrance to a shop two doors away.
Feeling safe in the darkness, Ken poked his head out
far enough to see.</p>

<p class='c015'>The broad-shouldered man who came out of the
small cigar store was wearing a pea jacket. A knitted
stocking cap perched high on the round head above his
short bull neck.</p>

<p class='c015'>He walked toward the boys and passed within a few
yards of them.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>“He’s got it,” Sandy said quietly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“One more link,” Ken murmured. “Come on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The package held tightly under the man’s arm appeared
to be the same one Pete had delivered a few
minutes before.</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys moved out after him as he walked on into
the night.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The man in the pea jacket led them southward along
South Street. On their right stood the long row of
buildings occupied by wholesale sea-food merchants—identifiable
now even in the darkness by an almost overpowering
smell of fish. Across the street, on their left,
were the great sheds and docks that extended out over
the East River itself. Sometimes, beyond them, the black
bow of a freighter could be seen looming up against
the gray-black sky.</p>

<p class='c015'>They passed the huge Fulton Fish Market, where
only a few lights twinkled now in the vast empty spaces
that would swarm with activity when the early-morning
deliveries began.</p>

<p class='c015'>The man ahead of them walked at a steady pace,
hands deep in his pockets, the collar of his pea jacket
turned up high around his ears. He seemed in no hurry
to get inside out of the cold.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wow!” Ken said softly, as a sudden bitter gust of
wind straight off the icy river almost drove them back
against the building they were passing. “If this turns
out to be a wild-goose chase—if he’s just a sailor on the
way back to his ship with a couple of cartons of cigarettes—”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>“Stop!” Sandy told him. “There’s got to be some good
reason for us going through all this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There ought to be,” Ken agreed grimly.</p>

<p class='c015'>His eyes were watering from the wind. He rubbed
his gloved hands across them, clearing his blurred vision
in time to see the man they were following veer
across the street on a long diagonal. Suddenly he vanished
around the corner of a ramshackle building built
directly on the river. The boys speeded up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Easy,” Ken said, when they reached the building.</p>

<p class='c015'>Just beyond it the sidewalk was edged by a tall fence
of corrugated iron, but between the building and the
beginning of the fence was an opening.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He went through here,” Ken said, as they approached
it. He peered around the edge of the building
and saw that the fence walled off a great cement-floored
dock, stretching into the river some five hundred
feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>At its far end glowed a single light, which faintly
silhouetted the figure of the man in the pea jacket, still
moving steadily away from them.</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys slipped through the opening after him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Keep against the wall,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'>They moved quietly forward, in the deep shadowy
protection of the building that bordered the dock for
its first hundred feet or so. Beyond the building, in the
open water that surrounded the rest of the great pier,
the boys could discern a row of moored boats, the stern
of one snubbed against the bow of the next.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>“Fishing boats,” Sandy murmured. “But they wouldn’t
be going out this early in the evening, would they? He
wouldn’t be reporting to work now if—”</p>

<p class='c015'>He broke off as the man, up ahead, swung toward the
opposite side of the long pier.</p>

<p class='c015'>For the first time the boys saw that there were craft
moored there too. It was too dark to make them out
clearly, but they were obviously much larger than the
fishing boats.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Barges?” Sandy whispered questioningly.</p>

<p class='c015'>They flattened themselves against the wall of the
building, near its riverward end, to see what the man
would do. When he reached the edge of the dock he
seemed to wait a minute, perhaps peering around to see
if he was alone. And then they could see his shadowy
shape mounting what must have been a ladder against
the craft’s side.</p>

<p class='c015'>A moment later there was the sound of a door creaking
open and shut, and then a weak yellow light appeared
some distance above the water. It flickered,
dimmed, and then brightened again.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s a barge all right. He’s gone into the cabin,” Ken
said. “Let’s go take a look.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They hurried across the windswept dock into the
partial shelter of the craft moored on the opposite side.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were three barges, all of them large and each
supplied with a small cabin aft. But only the cabin of
the barge nearest the shore—the one the man had entered—seemed
occupied. The barges were moored end
to end, the flat stern of the first one backed up against
the shore. Its heavy timber bulwarks rose some six feet
above the level of the dock, and the boys could dimly
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>make out the rough curve of its piled cargo rising even
higher. It seemed to be coal or stone. At the aft end
they found the ladder the man had mounted.</p>

<p class='c015'>Their feet were almost silent on the concrete of the
pier’s floor, but the wind was noisy enough to have
covered any accidental sounds they might have made
as they walked on down toward the end of the dock.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nobody aboard either of the others,” Sandy said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Doesn’t seem to be,” Ken agreed. “Let’s climb
aboard the middle one. Maybe from there we can see
what’s going on in our friend’s cabin.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy hesitated only for an instant. “I don’t suppose
we have any right to be doing it,” he said. “But come
on. Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken scrambled up the ladder of the middle barge.
He paused when his head was level with the top.</p>

<p class='c015'>“O.K.,” he whispered down to Sandy below him. “All
clear.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was standing in the protection of the barge
cabin’s aft wall when Sandy joined him.</p>

<p class='c015'>The cabin occupied about two-thirds of the barge’s
twenty-five-foot width, leaving a passageway only a
few feet wide on either side, between the cabin wall
and the bulwark that dropped sheer to the water line.
The faint glow from the lights on the street disclosed
that the ten-foot space aft of it was mostly open deck,
cluttered with heavy coiled lines. To one side a small
shed was attached and a sizable bin filled with large
lumps of soft coal. Forward of the cabin was the cargo
hold, heaped high with crushed stone.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>They looked down toward the lighted cabin of the
next barge, nearly a hundred feet away. Its hold also
was loaded with stone. The single window in the cabin’s
forward wall was small and partially covered by curtains.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We certainly can’t see anything from here,” Sandy
said disgustedly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I was afraid we couldn’t,” Ken admitted. “If we
want to find out what’s in that package, we’ll have to
get closer.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They moved reluctantly aft, away from the wall’s
protection, until they were standing at the gunwale.
Four feet of black space separated them from the other
barge.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s an easy jump,” Ken muttered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure,” Sandy agreed. They couldn’t see the water,
swirling and eddying below, but they could hear it
sucking and gurgling against the hulls of the barges.
“But I’d hate to miss it. If we fell down between these
two tubs—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We won’t miss it,” Ken assured him.</p>

<p class='c015'>He leaped lightly across the expanse of treacherous
water. For an instant, as he landed on the far side, he
waved his arms to maintain his balance on the eighteen-inch-wide
timber that formed the barge’s bulwark.
Then he steadied himself and reached a hand back
toward Sandy.</p>

<p class='c015'>“O.K.?” he asked, as the other landed beside him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy sighed with relief. “O.K.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They stood there for a moment, considering the best
way to get forward toward the cabin.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was clearly only one route to take. It would be
impossible to cross the mound of stone in the hold
without causing a clatter that would reveal their presence.
They would have to walk around the edge of the
barge, along the narrow bulwark.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>Ken started toward the left—the side of the barge
away from the dock. As soon as he reached the corner
and moved carefully around it, to start aft, the wind
caught him so fiercely that he had to drop to his knees
to keep from being blown off his feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>He felt Sandy drop down behind him a moment
later.</p>

<p class='c015'>The vicious gust blew itself out shortly, but not until
both boys were stiff from holding that huddled position
in the freezing air.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come on.” Ken barely breathed the words as he got
slowly to his feet and started aft again.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were other gusts after that, not quite so fierce
as the first one, but strong enough so that Ken could
feel himself tottering toward the sharp-edged pile of
stone on his right. And when he leaned his weight
against the wind, to steady himself, the black water
below seemed to rise toward him, its oily surface glinting
with menace.</p>

<p class='c015'>Halfway along the length of the barge they had to
rest, lowering themselves to their knees again and
grasping at the splintery timbers with numb hands.
The lighted window they were heading for still seemed
a long distance away.</p>

<p class='c015'>When they finally reached the small aft deck, and
dropped down from their hazardous perch, they huddled
together for a minute. Both of them were shaking,
partly from cold, partly from the nervous tension of
their precarious journey.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>But as soon as Ken could breathe evenly again he
started toward the cabin, feeling Sandy behind him.
He headed toward the rear corner of the little structure.
There was a window in the back wall, too, as he could
see, and on that side they would be protected from the
worst of the wind.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bracing himself lightly against the cabin wall for
support, he raised himself upright from a crouched position,
until he could peer through the narrow slit between
the imperfectly drawn dark curtains. When
Sandy rose up beside him he shifted slightly to make
room for him. Then they turned and looked at each
other in the faint light that came through the slit.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And we risked our necks to see that!” Sandy
breathed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken had no answer.</p>

<p class='c015'>He didn’t know what he had expected to see inside
the cabin, but certainly he had anticipated something
more dramatic than the scene that showed itself there.</p>

<p class='c015'>The interior of the tiny room was snug and pleasant.
In the light of an oil lamp, hung on an old-fashioned
wall bracket, the room glowed warmly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Like a picture on a calendar,” Ken thought to himself
with anger and amazement.</p>

<p class='c015'>The man they had followed was no longer wearing
his pea jacket or his cap. In a heavy turtle-necked
sweater he sat at ease in front of a small, round coal
stove. There was a white mug in his hands, and he was
in the act of tipping his head back to drain the last swallow
from it. Then he leaned forward toward the stove,
refilled his cup from a white enameled coffeepot, and
settled back again.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>His feet were propped on the rim of the sand-filled
box in which the stove stood, while his whole big body
relaxed in warmth and comfort. As they watched he
reached toward a paper bag on a gleaming oilcloth-covered
table and pulled out a fat doughnut.</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys could only see his back, but even the thick
folds of his neck seemed to wrinkle with pleasure as he
dunked the doughnut in the coffee and carried the
dripping object to his mouth.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let’s get out of here,” Sandy muttered. “This is
killing me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wait a minute.” Ken craned his neck, trying for a
new angle of vision through the narrow slit. Finally he
spotted what he had been looking for. The package the
man had brought from the cigar store lay, still unopened,
on one of the bunks against the port bulkhead.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’d certainly like to know what’s in that thing,” Ken
whispered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll go in and ask him,” Sandy offered. “Maybe he’ll
give me a cup of coffee and a doughnut while I’m
there. Even if he slit my throat afterward,” he added,
“it would almost be worth it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The man had finished the doughnut. He took his feet
off the box rim and let his chair come down on its front
legs with a thump. Still holding his coffee mug in one
hand, he reached for a poker with the other, shoved
aside the stove lid and shook down the fire.</p>

<p class='c015'>A shower of brilliant sparks flew out of the chimney
above the boys’ heads, immediately followed by a
burst of thick acrid black smoke. The wind twisted it
down onto them in a choking cloud.</p>

<p class='c015'>They buried their faces in their arms, trying to protect
themselves against the cabin wall.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>Ken choked back a cough, his head pounding with
the effort. Then he felt Sandy, close beside him, heave
convulsively in the first stages of a vast sneeze.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy’s head jerked back, his mouth uncontrollably
open.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken clamped a swift hand over it. “Quiet!” he begged,
in a frenzied whisper.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy made a final effort. The sneeze came, but only
as a slight snort muffled by the whipping wind. The
thunderous noise Ken had dreaded didn’t occur.</p>

<p class='c015'>“O.K.” Sandy straightened. “I’m all right now. But
let’s move, huh?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Might as well,” Ken agreed reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was convinced that the package lying in there on
the bunk contained something far more significant than
two cartons of cigarettes. But he had no proof for his
belief, and he could think of no way of finding such
proof.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Back the way we came?” Sandy’s whisper was definitely
unenthusiastic.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken took one last glance through the window. The
man was seated in his chair again, the coffee mug beside
him on the table now and a newspaper spread wide
in his hands. He had the air of a man who has settled
down for a long quiet evening.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken shook himself impatiently. There was certainly
no reason for them to remain here longer.</p>

<p class='c015'>He realized that he hadn’t answered Sandy’s last
question. He didn’t want to return the way they had
come any more than Sandy did. And the ladder leading
down from the barge they were on was less than twenty
feet away.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>He jerked his head toward it. “Let’s take a chance
and use this one.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy nodded his agreement.</p>

<p class='c015'>They walked carefully toward it across the deck,
sliding their feet in the darkness to avoid the possibility
of stepping down on something that might upset their
balance.</p>

<p class='c015'>They had covered only half the distance to the ladder
when they both started and froze where they stood.</p>

<p class='c015'>A car had swept onto the dock, through the same
opening in the fence which they had used earlier. It
swerved to the right after it had gone only a few feet,
and its headlights illuminated the barge in a wash of
light.</p>

<p class='c015'>With a single motion the boys dropped flat on the
deck.</p>

<p class='c015'>Somewhere below them the car stopped. The buzz
of its engine was cut off and the lights disappeared.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken touched Sandy’s arm. “Get back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>If the driver of the car came aboard the barge, they
would certainly be discovered where they lay. And it
was too late to use the barge ladder now. They might
walk directly into the arms of whoever had just driven
up on the dock below.</p>

<p class='c015'>Slithering along the deck like eels, they went back
the way they had just come, and on past the cabin
window to take shelter behind the cabin’s far wall, in
the narrow space between it and the bulwark.</p>

<p class='c015'>As soon as they stopped moving they could hear
sounds. Somebody was climbing the ladder. There was
a dull thud as the new arrival jumped down onto the
deck of the barge.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>From inside the cabin there was a metallic banging,
and suddenly once more the boys were enveloped in a
cloud of choking smoke.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy had learned his lesson. He jerked down the
zipper of his windbreaker and ducked his head inside
at the first whiff.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken, who had been concentrating on the sounds
around the corner of the cabin, was caught completely
unprepared. He had inhaled a lungful of smoke before
he realized it. His shoulders began to heave as Sandy’s
had done a few minutes before.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken held his breath. He pinched his nose tightly
between thumb and finger. But the sneeze pushed
harder than ever at the back of his throat.</p>

<p class='c015'>Even through the buzzing in his ears he could hear
the knock at the cabin door and the voice that said,
“Open up, Cal. It’s me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken gasped. He felt as if his eyes were about to pop
out of his head. The urge to sneeze was irresistible.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Coming,” the man inside the cabin answered, and
the stove lid clattered back on the stove.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was nothing Ken could do about it. He
sneezed. His whole body seemed to erupt in one vast
explosion, loud enough—it seemed to him—to wake
the dead.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a clang inside the cabin and pounding
footsteps across the deck outside.</p>

<p class='c015'>Before Ken and Sandy could even scramble to their
feet an overcoated figure loomed above them at the
corner of the cabin wall. Even in the faint light from
the window he was recognizable, although he apparently
was still unable to see in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>It was the man they knew as Barrack. His eyes were
slitted in an effort to penetrate the black shadow thrown
by the cabin wall.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Who’s there?” It was not the affable voice he had
used the night before when he had called so inexplicably
at Richard Holt’s apartment. It was a curt,
furious snarl.</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys held themselves motionless. The slightest
gesture would give away their whereabouts.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Barrack, who had been fumbling in his pocket,
drew out a torch and flicked it on. Ken and Sandy,
spotlighted in the brilliant glare, instinctively shut
their eyes against it.</p>

<p class='c015'>For a long moment none of them stirred.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Barrack spoke in a voice of controlled fury.
“What are <i>you</i> two doing here?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken opened his eyes a fraction of an inch into the
bright white light. It was enough to show him the gun
that Barrack was holding leveled at their heads.</p>

    <div>A SCHEME FOR ATTACK</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Barrack kept his pistol pointed at them. “Cal!” he
shouted.</p>

<p class='c015'>Inside the cabin there was a crash.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken could visualize what had happened. The big
man in the turtle-neck sweater, hurrying toward the
door, had apparently knocked down a chair in the
crowded little room.</p>

<p class='c015'>For an instant Barrack’s eyes shifted toward the
cabin doorway.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy moved before the man’s glance had refocused.
Like a steel spring uncoiling, his six feet straightened
out—one shoulder forward, aimed for Barrack’s midriff.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken leaped forward too, only a fraction of a second
behind him. He chopped at the hand that held the gun
just as Sandy’s shoulder made contact.</p>

<p class='c015'>The gun flew wide over the side of the barge. Barrack
almost followed it, under the impact of two hundred
pounds of well-conditioned muscle.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>Almost before Barrack landed heavily against the
bulwark, the boys had spun around and were tearing
across the deck toward the ladder. The man named
Cal emerged through the cabin doorway just as they
charged past. He never had a chance to stop them. He
hadn’t even raised his fist when Ken struck him a
glancing blow that threw him backward.</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys didn’t attempt to find the actual location of
the ladder in the darkness. They vaulted straight over
the bulwark, side by side, and landed on the concrete
pier six feet below with bone-jarring thuds.</p>

<p class='c015'>But both of them were on their feet an instant later
and pounding toward the street, the shouts behind them
echoing in their ears.</p>

<p class='c015'>They reached the opening in the fence just as they
heard the engine of Barrack’s car roar into life.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken glanced briefly back over his shoulder. Barrack
had parked the car with its nose pointed toward the
barge. He would have to back up and swing around.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy was glancing quickly up and down the dark
deserted street.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s a diner down there!” he panted. The glow
of neon lighting he was pointing to was at least three
blocks away, but it seemed to be the only haven in
sight.</p>

<p class='c015'>They had covered less than a block when Barrack’s
car emerged from the pier. It paused there briefly. The
driver was apparently looking to see which way they
had gone. And then, apparently, he sighted them. The
car swung in their direction, its tires screaming.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ll never make it!” Sandy gasped.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s eyes caught a flash of light on the opposite
side of the street. He turned his head toward it without
breaking his stride. “Look!”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>A taxi was entering South Street from the cross street
just ahead and slowing to a stop at the corner. As the
two sailors in the back seat climbed out, Ken and Sandy
were already tearing across toward it. Barrack’s headlights
were close enough to outline them clearly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hey!” Sandy yelled as they ran. “Cab!”</p>

<p class='c015'>The driver waved a casual hand to let them know he
saw them coming.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken tumbled inside just as Barrack’s car shot past.
Sandy piled in on top of him. The driver, only mildly
surprised at their haste, said, “In a hurry, huh?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken watched Barrack brake to a stop just ahead of
the taxi.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not particularly—not any more,” Ken managed to
answer. “Take us uptown to Radio City, please.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The cab swung in a wide U turn and headed north.
Ken and Sandy slumped wearily back on the seat. For
a moment they had all they could do to catch their
breath.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We messed that up for fair,” Sandy said finally, still
gulping for air.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I messed it up,” Ken said. “Me and my big sneeze.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Say, bud”—the driver pivoted his head to speak to
them—“is that joker behind us a friend of yours?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken sat up and swung around to look through the
rear window. A pair of headlights were close behind
them.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not that I know of,” Ken said. “Why?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s the car that stopped just ahead of me as you
got in,” the driver explained. “He made a U turn, just
like I did, and he’s been on our tail ever since. Thought
maybe he was trying to catch up with you.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>Ken and Sandy looked at each other in the glow of a
street light they were passing.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s no friend of ours,” Ken said decisively.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You don’t mind if I try to lose him then?” the driver
asked. “I hate a fellow that nudges my rear end like
that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s O.K. with us,” Sandy assured him. “Go right
ahead.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t like this,” Ken muttered. He kept one eye on
the rear window. “Here he comes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t like it, either,” Sandy agreed. “He probably
would have used that gun, but fortunately we didn’t
get a chance to find out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If anybody asked him, of course,” Ken said, “he’d
undoubtedly say he was just protecting private property
from trespassers—and there’s no doubt that’s what we
were.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure,” Sandy said. He was rubbing absent-mindedly
at the knee he had landed on when he dove off the
barge. “But the way he had that gun ready—” He shook
his head. “There must be a bigger danger of trespassers
around stone-loaded barges than I thought.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Maybe that’s not plain stone—maybe it’s gold ore,”
Ken suggested flippantly, but his eyes glued to the back
window were still grim. Barrack’s car had followed them
skillfully around two more corners.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, indubitably.” Sandy’s tone matched Ken’s. “Or
platinum ore. And now explain why it was Barrack
who had the gun, instead of—what did he call him?—Cal.
And what Barrack was doing there in the first
place.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>Their cab, driving up lower Broadway now—a deserted
canyon at that hour of the evening—stopped for
a red light. The car behind stopped too.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think I’ll get out and give that guy back there a
poke in the snoot,” the driver of the cab said. His hand
was already on the door handle. “His lights are driving
me nuts.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken spoke quickly. “Wait until we get out. We’re
in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well—O.K.” The driver sighed as he settled back
behind his wheel. “Maybe by then I’ll have my temper
under control. <i>I</i> know I shouldn’t always be wanting to
give a guy a punch in the snoot. It’s just my impulsive
nature.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken and Sandy laughed in spite of themselves.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know just how you feel,” Sandy assured the man
in the front seat. “I have the same trouble myself.” But
the laughter was out of his voice before he stopped
speaking. There was a menacing quality in the persistence
of those lights behind them.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they neared Fourteenth Street the traffic began
to get heavier. Soon the cab driver was able to swing
in and out of the lanes of cars in a series of swift maneuvers
that forced Barrack’s car to drop behind.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’ll hold him,” the driver said with satisfaction.
“He’s pocketed now!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But something tells me he won’t stay pocketed,”
Sandy murmured. “Even if we really lose him he could
catch up with us later at your father’s apartment.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And if he arrives there, complete with gun, to ask
what we were doing on the barge,” Ken said, “what do
we tell him? That we were just out for a moonlight
stroll along the river?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>“We ask him what <i>he</i> was doing there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And of course he’d tell us,” Ken said sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course.” Sandy laughed shortly. “Everything
about him so far has been absolutely straightforward—the
way he came to your father’s apartment, the way
he told us he didn’t know Grace, the way he left that
package for Grace to pick up—” He broke off angrily.
“I’m certainly beginning to be mighty curious about
that man. But I don’t see how we can learn much more
about him, now that he’s got us spotted. If we turn up
in his way again—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve got an idea!” Ken leaned forward to speak to
the driver. “We changed our minds. Take us to the
Pennsylvania Station instead.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What? Penn Station?” The driver glanced around in
surprise. “But I thought you were in such a hurry to get
to Radio City.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, we were,” Ken said. “But—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You have to humor him,” Sandy explained to the
back of the man’s head. “It’s his impulsive nature.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh. Sure. In that case. Anything your little heart
desires.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The cab swung left on Twenty-ninth Street and sped
westward toward Seventh Avenue. There it turned right
for the big railroad station a few blocks northward. It
was difficult to be certain, in these busy streets, but
Ken thought he spotted Barrack’s car half a block behind.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What’s your idea?” Sandy asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You gave it to me,” Ken answered. “We’re going to
make Barrack think we won’t turn up in his way again.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>The cab swung down into the ramp that led directly
into the terminal. Ken paid the driver, thanked him, and
then led Sandy through the door into the station.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let’s wait here a minute,” he said, just inside.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Our shadow. We don’t want to lose him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I thought—!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here he comes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack’s car was pulling up to the same spot their
taxi had left only a few seconds before. The man in the
turtle-neck sweater, wearing his pea jacket again—apparently
he hadn’t had time to stop for his cap—jumped
out of the front seat. Then Barrack, at the wheel, drove
the car away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let’s go.” Ken took Sandy’s arm and moved casually
forward. “I’m glad we’ve got Cal instead of Barrack.
From the way he banged around in that cabin tonight,
I don’t think he’s very quick on his feet.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It certainly would be nice,” Sandy said, “if I knew
what you had in that alleged mind of yours.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken glanced over his shoulder. “Good,” he murmured.
“He’s only about fifty feet behind. Everything’s
proceeding according to plan.” He steered Sandy toward
the Information Desk. “When is the next train to
Brentwood?” he asked in a clear voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Brentwood? Just a minute.” The information clerk
consulted a schedule. “Eight one. On Track Ten.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thank you,” Ken said. “Might as well get our tickets
now,” he added to Sandy.</p>

<p class='c015'>At the ticket window, Ken spoke loudly and clearly.
Their shadow, partly concealed by a mountainous heap
of luggage, was only a few feet away.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>As Ken tucked the two one-way tickets to Brentwood
into his pocket he said, glancing at his watch, “We’ve
got just an hour. How about something to eat?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s the first sensible thing you’ve said in the last
ten minutes,” Sandy muttered under his breath. He
pulled out his wallet and counted the money in it. “Not
quite six dollars,” he announced. “How much have you
got with you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken checked. “Eight dollars and some change.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right. I’ll take command of this phase of the
action. Ever since I saw our friend there eating that
doughnut and drinking that hot coffee—while we were
freezing out in the cold—I’ve wanted to pay him back.
And I know just the way to do it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They both still felt stiff and bruised from their leap
to the dock, but the comparative warmth of the cab and
the greater warmth of the station had thawed them
slightly. They walked almost briskly toward the largest
of the station’s many restaurants. Sandy led the way
inside and chose a table in full view of anyone standing
outside the big window overlooking the busy arcade.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken, shielding himself behind a large menu, stole a
look through the glass. “He’s there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good.” Sandy grinned. “He’s going to love this. I
could tell from the way he was eating in the cabin that
he really enjoys his food.” He looked up at a waiter who
had hurried to their table. “We’ll start with clams on
the half shell,” he said. “Then soup—onion, I guess.
And then a sirloin for two—very rare. With it we’d
better have some....”</p>

<p class='c015'>When the waiter headed for the kitchen a few minutes
later he had a slightly glazed expression on his
face.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>“I take it we’re not really going back to Brentwood,”
Sandy said over the clams. “That act of buying the
tickets in a loud voice was just an act?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken looked at him innocently. “Of course we <i>could</i>
go back tonight—but then we’d miss the basketball
game.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy lifted an eyebrow at him. “I see. And what
else would we miss?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken shrugged. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “All I
really had in mind was convincing them that we were
clearing out of town—going home to Brentwood and
our own business. I thought it would calm their suspicions.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“By ‘them’ you mean Barrack and our boy Cal out
there?” Sandy glanced through the window for an instant.
“He’s drooling!” he announced happily.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Barrack and Cal,” Ken agreed. “Grace too. I’m assuming
they’re all tied in together in something.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think that’s pretty obvious,” Sandy said. “But in
what? What kind of game are they playing—skulking
all over town that way, mysteriously transferring packages
from one person to another? And apparently ruining
what used to be a perfectly good wholesale tobacco
business?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your guess is as good as mine,” Ken said. He waited
while cups of steaming soup were substituted for the
plates of empty clamshells. “The only explanation that
occurs to me,” he said quietly, “is that Grace is a fence—a
receiver and distributor of stolen goods. It would
explain his lack of interest in the tobacco business.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>Sandy considered the suggestion, his eyes slowly
brightening. “I think you’re right. Then Barrack is
probably a thief. That’s why he had to be so careful
about transmitting that package to Grace.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken nodded. “And maybe Grace uses Cal, on the
barge, for transportation. Cal could get the stuff out of
New York.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy stopped with a spoonful of soup halfway to his
mouth. “But then what was Barrack doing on the barge?
If he’s afraid to have any open contact with Grace, why
wouldn’t he also be afraid to show himself around the
barge?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken thought for a long moment and then shook his
head. “I give up. I can’t think of any explanation for
that—unless he’s trying to cross Grace up some way.”
He frowned down into his soup. “I wish we’d had a
chance to learn more about the Tobacco Mart when
we were down there this afternoon. I can’t help but
feel that that’s the center of whatever’s going on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy filled in the brief wait between the soup and
the steak with a thick piece of French bread, lavishly
buttered. “It’s certainly too bad,” he said, “that we don’t
know just a little more about at least one of those characters.
Then maybe we could go to the police.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s certainly nothing we could tell the police
now,” Ken said. “Of course, if we hung around the
Tobacco Mart again tonight—after we’d convinced our
friend out there that we’d gone meekly off to Brentwood—we
<i>might</i> find something interesting.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy’s glare cut him off. “That is the kind of suggestion,”
he said loftily, “that has, in the past, landed
us in some unpleasant situations.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>Ken grinned. “That’s right. And also, quite often, into
some pretty exciting yarns. For which we have earned
a reputation. Not to mention,” he added, “sizable
checks.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Money is not everything,” Sandy informed him.
“And reputation is not everything, either.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll toss you for it,” Ken said, pulling a quarter out
of his pocket. “Heads, we make one more quick survey
of the Tobacco Mart tonight. Tails, we forget the whole
business.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy was still maintaining his air of firm disinterest.
“You are taking advantage of my well-known sportsman’s
instinct,” he said. “I cannot refuse to toss you for
it, but I insist upon going on record as opposed to the
whole idea.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken handed him the coin. Sandy flicked it up in the
air with his thumb and watched it as it fell to the table.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Tails it is,” Ken announced. “All right, we forget the
whole business.” He attacked his steak. “This is certainly
good, isn’t it?” he remarked conversationally.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How can you eat at a time like this?” Sandy demanded.
“Aren’t you interested in the outcome of the
coin tossing?” And when Ken looked up at him, with
an air of puzzlement, Sandy added, “I thought it was
understood that I would toss for two out of three.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh.” Ken grinned. “Was it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Certainly.” Sandy tossed the coin again. “Heads,”
he announced.</p>

<p class='c015'>He tossed it the third time. “Heads again,” he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>With a heavy mock sigh he handed the quarter back
to Ken. “Your impulsive nature has again overcome my
good judgment,” he said. “You have forced me to agree
to accompany you on a safari to the Tobacco Mart.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At seven fifty-seven, four minutes before the Brentwood
train was due to depart, the boys left the restaurant
and sauntered down to the head of the stairway
leading to Track Ten. At exactly eight o’clock they
walked down the stairs, stopping at the bottom to make
sure they were still being followed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“All aboard!” the conductor was calling. “All aboard!”</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys entered the car nearest them and began to
walk toward the front of the train. Through the windows
they caught a glimpse of Cal, keeping pace with
them along the platform.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they entered the next car there was a slight lurch,
and then another. The train was starting to move. The
boys sank down into an empty seat.</p>

<p class='c015'>An instant later Ken leaped up. “O.K. We’ve left
him. Come on.” He ran toward the forward end of the
car with Sandy close at his heels. The trainman was just
closing the door when they reached him.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>“Wrong train!” Ken gasped, pushing past him. He
leaped to the platform and ducked immediately
behind a baggage truck piled high with mailbags.
Sandy joined him there.</p>

<p class='c015'>They let the last car of the train rumble past before
they risked a look.</p>

<p class='c015'>The man in the pea jacket had already turned his
back on them and was walking toward the stairway.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ll take the other stairs back there,” Ken said.
“Keep behind the pillars.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They reached the upper level before Cal did, in time
to watch him cross the waiting room and take the
escalator to the Seventh Avenue exit.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He doesn’t know much about Penn Station,” Ken
murmured. “Come on. We’ll get a cab before he does.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He ducked down a short flight of steps to an intermediate
level and ran for the taxicab stand. Less than
a minute later they were once more leaning back
against leather cushions and Sandy was saying, for the
second time that day, “Chatham Square—as fast as you
can get there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Twenty minutes afterward they were crouched down
in a narrow passageway between two buildings, a few
doors down the street from the Tobacco Mart. They
waited nearly five minutes before a cab drew up before
the shop’s darkened windows, and Cal darted out of it
across the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c015'>His heavy knock on the door sounded above the roar
of the departing taxi’s motor. They could even hear his
voice saying, “It’s me—Cal.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The door of the Tobacco Mart opened, Cal disappeared
inside, and the door closed again.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now?” Sandy asked.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>“I’ll just take a look around first.” Ken sidled out of
the alleyway and stood in the shadows. There were few
people on the street. The Chinese Theater across the
square was still lighted up, and the library was still
open. But the immediate vicinity of the Tobacco Mart
was quiet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let’s go,” Ken murmured.</p>

<p class='c015'>They approached the Tobacco Mart and slipped
quickly past it. The front part of the shop was entirely
dark, but a dim light seemed to show somewhere in the
rear, as if from behind a partition.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken stopped at a narrow door just beyond the shop
and gave it a tentative push. It moved inward with a
slight creak. He pushed it half open and peered inside.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come on.” Ken couldn’t keep the triumph out of his
voice. He had noticed the door that afternoon, from his
post in the library, and had guessed—after his conversation
with the delivery boy—that it led to the floors
above the Tobacco Mart. Apparently it was left unlocked
for the convenience of the third-floor tenant.</p>

<p class='c015'>On the far side of the door, which they closed carefully
after they had slipped through it, they found
themselves in a musty hallway. By the street glow
which faintly penetrated the grimy pane they could see
two mailboxes set into the wall. The door of one hung
open on a broken hinge.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken risked a quick flash from his pencil flashlight. It
revealed a flight of stairs that mounted upward against
the left wall. Ken put a cautious foot on the first tread
and let it take his weight. There was only a single creak—a
faint one. Walking close to the wall, to minimize
the possibility of other creaks, Ken led the way to the
top.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>A door, presumably leading to the empty second-floor
apartment above the shop, was to their right. It
had no lock. Ken’s flash showed a gaping round hole
where the hardware had once been. He turned the
flash off.</p>

<p class='c015'>He waited a moment, listening. The silence was complete.
Then he pushed the door open, looked into the
empty room beyond, and led the way in.</p>

<p class='c015'>They seemed to be in the center room of a three-room
flat. An archway separated it from the room overlooking
the street—a room faintly lighted by a glow
through unwashed windows. A narrower open doorway
separated it from the rear room.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken remembered the dim light that they had seen at
the rear of the Tobacco Mart. He turned toward the
rear room of the second-floor apartment.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Easy,” he whispered. Sandy, behind him, needed no
warning. He edged his feet forward as cautiously as if
he were stalking a deer in the silent woods.</p>

<p class='c015'>At the doorway that opened into the rear room they
paused, a pair of silent shadows.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly Ken grabbed Sandy’s hand and pointed it
at the thing he saw—a six-inch ragged round hole in
the floor against one wall. Light came up through it,
like a column of dim dust-filled smoke. And also, faintly
through the opening, drifted the mumble of voices.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were on the threshold of what must once have
been a kitchen, Ken thought. And the hole in the floor
had once given passage to a drain pipe.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hardly daring to believe in their luck, he began to
move carefully toward the upward-shining ray of light.
Sandy edged along beside him.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>They progressed scarcely an inch at a time, aware
that they might be heard at any moment by the occupants
of the room just under their feet. It took long
minutes to cross the floor. But the voices below grew
more distinct with every step they took. Before they
reached their goal they had both identified the three
voices taking part in the conversation below.</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys had heard them all before. They were the
voices of Barrack, Grace, and Cal.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first full sentence they heard distinctly was
spoken by Cal.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But they went back home—to that town called
Brentwood,” Cal said. “I tell you I saw them get on the
train, and I saw the train pull out. So what is there to
worry about?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know what you told us.” Grace’s voice, which had
been so diffident and polite that day in Sam Morris’s
jewelry store, now had a startling note of authority and
command. “But nobody can tell us what they’re going
to do when they get there. Are they going to take their
little story to the cops?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What story could they take?” Barrack demanded.
“They’d be fools to report that they had a gun pointed
at them on the barge tonight. Cal here could vouch
that they’d been trespassing. Cops would laugh at
them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Cops might not laugh if the kids said it was you who
had the gun,” Grace pointed out sharply.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Cal would have to say they were mistaken, that’s
all,” Barrack said. “I don’t know what you’re worrying
about.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>There was a moment’s silence. Ken, in the process of
lowering himself to his knees in order to look through
the hole, held his body completely still.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m worrying,” Grace said finally, “because they
turned up there at all. They saw you last night. They’d
seen me in that little jerkwater jewelry store. But how’d
they happen on the barge? If you can’t give me a good
answer to that, I think we ought to clear everything out
of this location immediately. How do we know they
haven’t already connected one of us with this place
too?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Be reasonable,” Barrack said. “They’re just kids.
They’re not geniuses from the F.B.I.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Anyway, you don’t have to worry about my end of
it,” Cal said cheerfully. “I’m taking care of that tonight.
If you just keep this stuff undercover for a while, nobody
can prove anything on any of us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Maybe so,” Grace said. “But what’s the good of producing
this stuff if we can’t distribute it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was finally on his knees, his hands on either side
of the hole. He brought his eye into line with the opening
just as Grace asked his question.</p>

<p class='c015'>The three men were seated around a table in the
room below. Their faces were in shadow but a light
bulb dangling from a cord illuminated the table’s surface.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken stifled a gasp. All over the table, like a scattered
pack of large cards, lay crisp fresh ten-dollar bills.</p>

<p class='c015'>Counterfeiters! The word sounded so loud in his
mind that for an instant Ken was afraid he had shouted
it. Swiftly he tugged Sandy down to join him.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>“This is good stuff,” Grace was saying. “And I’m not
going to let anything jeopardize our chances to make a
real killing with it. Believe me, it would take an expert
to tell them from the real thing.” He brought one of the
bills close to his eye to study it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy, upright on his knees again, pulled his tiny
new camera out of his pocket. He held it in the column
of light for Ken to see, and Ken nodded vehemently.</p>

<p class='c015'>A photograph of the men around that money-laden
table ought to be enough to send every Treasury agent
in the country to Chatham Square.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Ken saw that Sandy was rising carefully to his
feet. For a moment he was puzzled. Dimly he saw
Sandy gesture toward the outer room, and finally Ken
understood him. Sandy had to adjust his camera before
it would be ready for use, and realized they didn’t
dare use Ken’s flashlight so close to the hole. Some
slight reflection might be caught downstairs.</p>

<p class='c015'>They made their way back as far as the doorway with
the same caution they had used crossing the room
earlier. Ken’s hands were shaking a little by the time he
was holding his light for Sandy, and the redhead
seemed to be having some slight difficulty making the
delicate adjustments on his small camera. They could
no longer hear what the men below were saying. It was
impossible to know what evidence they were missing.
But if Sandy could get his picture that would furnish
all the evidence they needed.</p>

<p class='c015'>And they might be seriously in need of evidence—especially
if the men did decide, as Grace had suggested,
to clear everything out of their present location.
If they managed to accomplish that immediately, the
story Ken and Sandy could tell would seem to have little
basis in fact.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>Finally the boys were again creeping back to the hole
and Sandy was lowering himself carefully over it, until
he lay flat on the floor with the camera to his eye.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was close enough so that he could hear the conversation
below quite clearly again. Some decision
seemed to have been reached.</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right,” Grace was saying, “then your end will be
O.K., Cal. I don’t think anybody could ever trace your
purchase of the paper, Barrack. And all we’ve got on
hand went to the barge tonight. So when I get rid of
this stuff we’ll be ready for any temporary trouble those
kids can make.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re sure the ink can’t be traced?” Cal asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not a chance,” Barrack said firmly. “I ordered it
when I sent in the regular order for the print shop.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Carefully the boys began to edge back, away from the
hole. Ken was already trying to organize in his mind the
story he would tell the moment he could get to a phone.
The first important thing to impress on the authorities
would be—</p>

<p class='c015'>A dull pounding from downstairs broke in on his
train of thought. It was a moment before he realized
that someone must be knocking on the Tobacco Mart’s
front door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Who could that be?” Barrack’s voice betrayed his
tenseness.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You jumped like an old woman,” Grace said. “Just
stay quiet in here. I’ll see.” Footsteps moved quickly
over the floor, and a door opened.</p>

<p class='c015'>The moment the door shut again a hoarse cracked
voice said, “I came to tell you—there’s somebody upstairs.
I saw a light!”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>“What?” Grace almost shouted it. Then he seemed to
pull himself together. “That’s impossible. We’ve been
right here. We’d have heard if—What kind of a light?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Just a little dim flickery kind of thing. The library
was just closin’ up and they were tellin’ me I had to get
out. But I swear I saw somethin’—quite a ways back
from the windows.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a moment of paralyzed silence.</p>

<p class='c015'>Upstairs, in the musty darkness, Ken and Sandy were
as staggered by the newcomer’s announcement as were
the men below.</p>

<p class='c015'>Grace’s authoritative voice broke the stillness.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Barrack, you come with me upstairs! Get that gun
out of the drawer there. You get back outside, Andy—and
keep your eyes open. Cal, you take the back yard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s mind had begun to work again too.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was no longer time to retreat by the stairs they
had come up. They would run into Barrack and Grace
before they reached the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken flashed his light toward the rear windows of the
room they were in, hoping that it would reveal a fire
escape beyond one of them. The little beam flattened
out against the glass, unable to penetrate its thick coating
of grime.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There must be a fire escape!” Ken thought. He
swung his flashlight in an arc to pull Sandy toward the
windows with him.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first sash they tried slid up with a grating sound,
but it was too late to worry about noise.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s heart gave a leap when he saw the rusty shape
of the fire escape beyond it. They still had a chance!</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>In a split second they had both wriggled through the
open window onto the grating. Ten feet below them,
illuminated by the light from the rear windows of the
Tobacco Mart, was a small paved back yard.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy swung one leg over the railing, his big hands
firmly gripping the rickety metal framework. Behind
them they could hear footsteps pounding up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c015'>Just as Sandy prepared to swing his other leg over,
the back door of the shop below them flew open and
Cal stepped out into the courtyard. A pistol glinted in
his hand.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy’s leg lifted over the railing and in the same
motion he dropped. His feet struck Cal’s shoulders. The
impact swung the man halfway around—and then he
crumpled under the weight of Sandy’s body.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken landed beside him, miraculously on his feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Through the store!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy was up and had taken a step after him when
Cal’s flailing hand caught his ankle. Cal’s other hand,
still clutching the gun, came up from the pavement in a
great arc.</p>

<p class='c015'>The redhead’s fist shot downward toward Cal’s stubbled
chin. The hand on Sandy’s ankle loosened its grip.
The gun clattered to the concrete just as Cal’s head
thumped heavily against the same hard surface.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy spun around and ran after Ken.</p>

<p class='c015'>One after the other they hurdled a large carton that
stood in their way, swerved around a pile of shipping
containers, tore through the door into the outer shop,
and lunged toward the front exit. Ken’s fingers reached
for the knob.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>But before he could touch it the door opened inward,
knocking him back on his heels. Sandy cannoned into
him from behind.</p>

<p class='c015'>Grace’s square middle-aged figure was outlined in
the doorway. The gun in his hand was steady. He
brought it forward until it nudged against Ken’s chest.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Back up,” Grace said quietly. “It’s more private in
the rear of the store.” Without turning his head he addressed
Barrack, who had come up behind him. “Tell
Andy to stay on guard outside. Then come back here.
We have to decide what to do with these two snoopers.”</p>

    <div>A DESPERATE PLAN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Where’s Cal?” Grace said sharply.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were all in the back room, within the circle of
light that illuminated the table on which fresh green
bills were still scattered. Barrack and Grace, both with
guns, kept the boys between them.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Cal!” Grace called.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Coming!” The man spoke in a mumble, and when he
appeared at the rear door a moment later he was shaking
his head dazedly. But his head jerked up and his
big hand balled into a fist when he saw the boys. He
came toward them in a rush.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Shut that door!” Grace’s voice stopped him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal sketched a jab with his fist. “Just let me—!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I said shut that door.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“O.K.” Cal turned and slammed the back door shut
with a crash.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sit down—you two,” Grace ordered the boys. “And
put your hands flat on the table.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look here!” Sandy managed to get a note of angry
innocence into his voice. “I don’t know what you—”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>“Quiet.” Barrack added weight to the command with
a prod of his gun.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal laughed unexpectedly. “They’re sure not going to
be taking any stories to the police now.” He grinned
even as he massaged the reddening bruise on his chin.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What makes you think the police don’t already
know what we know?” Ken asked. His voice had
sounded uneven for the first few words, but he had
managed to steady it before the end of the sentence.
“And the Treasury men too?” he added for good measure.
“We’re with Global News, you know, and the way
we work—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I told you to keep quiet.” Grace sounded more impatient
than alarmed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look, Grace,” Cal said suddenly, “why don’t we—?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Grace turned on him angrily. “Whatever we’re going
to do,” he said, “we’re not going to discuss it now.” He
jerked his head toward the boys. “Keep them covered,
Barrack.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He disappeared into the front part of the shop for a
moment and returned with a roll of wrapping twine.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here, Cal,” he said, tossing it to him. “Tie their
hands.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Helpless between the two pointing guns, Ken and
Sandy had to submit. Cal took a vicious pleasure in his
task. He jerked their hands roughly behind them, and
when he bound the rough twine around their wrists he
pulled it so hard that it cut into the flesh.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Just tie them,” Grace said. “Don’t try to amputate
their hands.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’re all right,” Cal assured him. “But they’ll stay
tied, believe me.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>“We’ll put them in the cellar for the time being,”
Grace ordered. “They won’t be able to overhear us
from down there. And they won’t,” he added with a
faint smile, “be overheard themselves if they decided to
do a little yelling. The buildings on both sides of us are
empty until eight o’clock in the morning—and there’s
a heavy stone wall on the street side.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He opened a door in the side wall as he spoke, and
gestured to Barrack to lead the way down a flight of
stairs visible below. Barrack lighted the way with a
flashlight.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken and Sandy were prodded after him down the
rough uneven stairs into a damp, dank-smelling basement.
Old boxes littered the floor and cobwebs hung
from the beams like tattered gray curtains. For a moment,
in one corner, a pair of small bright eyes caught
the light from Barrack’s flash, and then there was a
scampering sound as the rat burrowed into the safety of
a pile of rubbish.</p>

<p class='c015'>At Grace’s order Barrack swung open a heavy door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“In there,” Grace told the boys.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal’s heavy hands thrust at their shoulder blades and
they half fell into an empty coalbin.</p>

<p class='c015'>The door swung shut behind them. They could hear
it being jammed into place as one of the men drove a
piece of timber against it from the outside.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then the footsteps of the departing men resounded
on the stairs.</p>

<p class='c015'>Almost immediately a faint scurrying began somewhere
near by in the heavy darkness.</p>

<p class='c015'>“More rats,” Sandy said between clenched teeth.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>Ken controlled his own instinctive shivering at the
thought. He knew that rats and snakes were the two
things Sandy hated most. “Just keep shuffling your
feet,” he said, “and they won’t come near us.” He shuffled
his own feet noisily on the gritty floor.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If I could just—!” Sandy broke off with a gasp and
Ken realized that he was straining at his bonds.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll never break that twine,” Ken told him. “Don’t
wear yourself out trying.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy let his breath out in a gust. “Guess you’re
right.” He moved a few steps. “But I can try the door.
Maybe—” He threw his weight against it, using his
shoulder as a battering ram.</p>

<p class='c015'>The wood didn’t even budge. Sandy tried a second
time, and a third, with no better results. Then he gave
up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Doesn’t make any sense, anyway,” he muttered.
“Even if we got out of this hole—” He stamped his feet
up and down several times, and somewhere a startled
rat squealed sharply. “I wish I’d taken the time to hit
dear old Cal a second time. If there’d been just two of
them to handle—It would have been even smarter if I
hadn’t tried to adjust my camera in the light of your
flash.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How could we have guessed,” Ken demanded, “that
one of those old men in the library reading room was a
lookout? Anyway,” he added, “we’d have been all right
if I hadn’t stopped on the way out to grab a couple of
those bills off the table. If I’d reached the door half a
second earlier I’d have had it open before Grace got
there and we could have been out on the street.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>“I didn’t know you had some of the bills.” There was
a desperate note in Sandy’s sudden laugh. “Well, they
say money talks. Maybe it’ll tell us how to get out of
here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Grace and his friends are going to get us out of here
themselves before tomorrow morning,” Ken said firmly.
“You could tell that from the way they talked. They’re
not going to risk keeping us here when the buildings on
either side are opened up.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Maybe they’re not going to keep us anywhere—alive,”
Sandy said. “Grace didn’t fall for your hint that
the police know as much about them as we do. Probably
he thinks he could just quietly put us out of the
way, without anybody ever guessing what had happened
to us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If he was going to do that, I think he’d have done it
immediately,” Ken said. He hoped he sounded more
convinced of that than he actually felt. “This is his base
of operations. I don’t think he’ll risk doing <i>anything</i>
here that might attract attention to it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Half an hour ago we were on the point of attracting
attention to the place ourselves,” Sandy said bitterly.
“But now that he’s got us under his thumb he doesn’t
have to worry any more. He’s safe.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He lashed out suddenly with his foot. There was a
piercing squeal and then the thud of a soft body against
the wall. “That’s one rat that won’t walk across my foot
again,” Sandy muttered. “I agree with you,” he went on
an instant later, “that they’ll probably move us out of
here. But the only place I want to go right now is to the
police—and somehow I don’t think that’s where they’ll
take us.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>“Use your head, will you?” Ken forced himself to
speak sharply. “If they’re going to take us some place
else, that will be our chance. Start thinking about that,
instead of—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Chance to make a break, you mean?” There was a
new, faintly hopeful note in Sandy’s voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“To make a break—or maybe to send a message.
Wait! I think I’ve got an idea!” Ken was no longer trying
to steady Sandy. He was caught up in the excitement
of the thought that had just struck him. “Those
phony bills I picked up—there are about five of them,
I think—are inside my windbreaker. Can you back up
to me and open the zipper?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think so,” Sandy said. “Why?” But he was feeling
his way toward Ken in the dark.</p>

<p class='c015'>“These are apparently good counterfeits,” Ken said,
turning so that Sandy’s fumbling hands would find his
zipper tab. “They’d probably fool most people—except
bank clerks.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So? I don’t get it. Hold still.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll hunch down to make it easier.” Ken scuffed his
feet noisily for a moment and then bent his knees until
the top of his windbreaker was even with Sandy’s
hands.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There it is.” Sandy had found the tab. “But my fingers
are so numb I can’t pull it down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Just hold it,” Ken directed. “I’ll stand up.” He
straightened slowly, and the slide fastener slid down as
he came erect. “Good. Now try to get hold of the bills
inside.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wait until I see if I can get the circulation going
again.” Sandy began to beat his hands against the wall.
“Go on with what you were saying,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>“If we can tear these bills in half and scatter them
along the way to—wherever they take us—we’ll be
leaving a trail for the police to follow,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy grunted. “But suppose the police don’t find
them? Suppose somebody else does? The proportion of
police to ordinary citizens in this town—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But it won’t matter who finds them,” Ken broke in.
“Look: what good is half a ten-dollar bill?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No good,” Sandy said shortly. “Especially to us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But suppose you found half a bill. What would you
do?” Ken persisted.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Take it to a bank,” Sandy said. “That would be the
only place that would—Bank!” he repeated suddenly.
“What a dope I am! The bank would spot it as a phony.
The person who brought it in would be questioned.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Right,” Ken said excitedly. He had had to make
Sandy figure it out for himself, to prove that his idea
was sound—that others might reach the same conclusion
he had himself. “And when they trace the location
of the various halves that are picked up, they’ll have a
rough chart of where we’ve gone. Provided,” he added,
less hopefully, “that we’re not taken out into the
country somewhere. We couldn’t count on the bills
being picked up anywhere except along a city street.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But Sandy’s spirits were now high enough for them
both. “They won’t waste the time to take us very far,”
he insisted. “And when a gang of Treasury men are
turned loose on the hunt, <i>they</i> won’t waste any time.
Come on. Let’s get those bills torn in two while we’ve
got the chance. Which side are they on?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken turned. “I’m right in back of you. They’re on my
right—tucked into my belt.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>“Got them!” Sandy fumbled a minute, remembering
to shuffle his feet as he did so. “Those rats are getting
braver every minute,” he muttered. Then he sighed. “I
can’t tear them by myself.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It needs both of us. Wait—let me help.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It was heartbreaking work. Standing back to back,
their hands almost numb, they kept laboriously at it.
Ken held a bill and Sandy tore the stiff paper a fraction
of an inch at a time. Fear that they might drop a piece
on the floor, and expose their possession of the bills,
made them doubly careful.</p>

<p class='c015'>But finally the job was done. Ken had five halves
stuffed into a back pocket, and so did Sandy. Even with
their hands bound they could pull them out and drop
them somewhere—if they ever got the chance.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If we were only untied,” Ken muttered, “I could
write a couple of words on each one. Dad’s name, maybe,
and the word Global. That ought to be a help if—”</p>

<p class='c015'>He stopped. There were footsteps coming down the
stairs. Even through the heavy door they could hear
Cal’s whining voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t help it if it is too early for you,” he was saying.
“I have to get the truck back by eleven. That’s
when he starts working.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If you’re worried that somebody will notice their
tied hands,” Barrack said, “let’s untie them temporarily.
I’ll keep a gun on them, in case they try to make a
break. And it’ll just be across the sidewalk.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right,” Grace said grudgingly. “That’s the way
we’ll have to do it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken held his lips against Sandy’s ear, while the men
outside were tugging the bracing timber away from the
door.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>“Help cover for me if we get a chance, and I’ll try to
scribble something on the bills,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Right.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A few moments later, in the beam of a flashlight and
under three watchful pairs of eyes and three guns, the
boys were rubbing at their loosened hands, trying to
revive feeling in the numbed fingers.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Never mind the calisthenics,” Grace ordered. “Get
going. Barrack, you go ahead of them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Upstairs, in the kitchen, Grace spoke again briefly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m afraid we’re going to have to inconvenience you
for a while,” he said with a pretense at politeness. “It’s
your own fault for sticking your noses into something
that’s not your business. But the inconvenience will be
temporary if you behave yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But make one move,” Barrack added, gesturing with
his gun, “and you’ll be worse than inconvenienced.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Follow him,” Grace then ordered the boys, indicating
Barrack.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the boys emerged onto the sidewalk they
looked quickly around. The nearest human being in
sight was a man nearly a hundred feet down the street,
with his back turned toward them. They didn’t need
the reminder of the guns prodding into their backs to
know how futile it would be to attempt to run for it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Get in here.” Barrack lifted the tarpaulin at the back
of a small delivery truck and pointed inside.</p>

<p class='c015'>The interior of the little truck was dark and smelled
overpoweringly of fish. Ken and Sandy sat side by side
on a couple of empty fish crates, with Ken close against
the driver’s closed cab. The canvas walls of the truck
fluttered against their backs. Barrack crawled in after
them. The flashlight in his hand held them in a steady
beam. He dropped the tarpaulin.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>“O.K., Cal,” he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>The tarpaulin was tied in place, the truck engine
started, and the vehicle moved off.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy leaned forward, an inch at a time, until he
half shielded Ken from Barrack’s view. Ken found a
stub of pencil in his pocket. He drew out one of the
half bills, with infinite care, and without daring to look
down at it scrawled two words that he hoped would be
legible.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy was supplying additional cover by making
conversation. “You’ll be picked up by tomorrow morning—at
the latest,” he said cheerfully to Barrack.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let me worry about that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“O.K. It’s your neck.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken forced his fingers between the canvas wall and
the side of the truck, the bit of paper held between
them. Then he let go and drew his hand back again.</p>

<p class='c015'>A gust of air had struck his neck as he thrust at the
canvas. Sandy tensed. He had felt it too. Ken hoped
that Barrack’s coat collar was high enough so that he
hadn’t noticed. He reached for another torn bill. Sandy
kept talking.</p>

<p class='c015'>One by one Ken scribbled on the bits of paper and
pushed them down the crack alongside the tarpaulin.
Each time he did so the wind blew in, sharp and cold,
and he held his breath. But Barrack apparently didn’t
feel the draught.</p>

<p class='c015'>When Ken finished the halves in his own pocket he
reached for those in Sandy’s, thankful that they happened
to be on the side next to himself.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>“What’s the penalty for counterfeiting these days?”
Sandy asked Barrack. The cheerfulness in his voice
indicated to Ken that he had felt Ken’s hand—that he
knew the sixth bit of paper was on its way outside.</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack didn’t answer.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Six?” Sandy pressed. “Years, I mean,” he added
quickly.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken shoved one more paper outside. “Seven maybe.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy seemed to be considering, until another cold
draft struck their necks. “Or eight,” he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack was still silent.</p>

<p class='c015'>The truck swerved sharply and stopped a moment
later. “We can settle on ten, I guess,” Ken said. “That’ll
hold him for a while.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy risked a quick pat on his arm in congratulation.</p>

<p class='c015'>The rear tarpaulin was lifted.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Get out,” Cal said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Barrack backed out first, his gun always ready, and
stood guard while the boys lowered themselves to the
ground. The moment they left the protection of the
truck a bitter wind hit them. They were back on the
pier again. Ken and Sandy were prodded up the ladder
which led to the deck of the barge they had hurriedly
left not long ago.</p>

<p class='c015'>But this time the little cabin of the barge, when they
were thrust into it, lacked the cozy air they had envied
earlier. Nothing had been changed. Cal’s coffeepot still
stood on the stove. But now, somehow, the cramped
little room seemed to smell of danger.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>Cal retied their hands again immediately, and as
tightly as he had the first time. Then he bound their
feet together, crossing their ankles first so that bone
pressed against bone and the boys were as helpless as
trussed chickens. And finally, with cruel pleasure, he
added a large patch of adhesive plaster over their
mouths.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Sandy was thrown into the lower bunk, and
Barrack and Cal picked Ken up and tossed him into the
upper one.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You know what to do?” Grace asked Cal.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know, all right.” Cal began to turn down the lamp.
“And they’ll be perfectly safe here until I take the
truck back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Three pairs of footsteps moved toward the door. It
was opened and shut, and the boys could hear it being
locked from the outside.</p>

<p class='c015'>Silence settled down heavily in the little room. Outside
a tugboat hooted sorrowfully. The stove clinked
once. Otherwise only the ticking of a clock marked the
stillness.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken grunted as loudly as he could past the plaster
over his mouth. Sandy grunted in answer.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken grunted again—an uneven series of sounds. A
moment later Sandy did the same. Interpreted into the
dots and dashes of the Morse code, the noises meant
“O.K.” Sandy was letting him know that he too realized
they could communicate.</p>

<p class='c015'>“B-I-L-L-S G-O-N-E,” Ken spelled out laboriously.
He felt certain Sandy was already aware of that, but to
tell him so gave Ken the comfort of contact.</p>

<p class='c015'>“G-O-O-D,” Sandy grunted back.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>They had done what they could. Before noon, Ken
hoped, there should be a small stream of people hopefully
applying to one bank or another, asking if the torn
bills they had found might be replaced by whole ones.
And soon afterward—if all went well—a small army of
police and Treasury agents would be combing the
lower east side area of New York.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken wondered if he should have written “Tobacco
Mart” on some of the bills. It might have directed
police attention to the spot. But, on the other hand, it
might instead have sent the finders of the bills to
Grace’s headquarters, and that would have defeated
Ken’s purpose.</p>

<p class='c015'>The minutes dragged by in the dark.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suppose, Ken found himself thinking, that none of
the bills were picked up? Or that none of the finders
were hopeful enough of being able to cash in on them
to take them to a bank?</p>

<p class='c015'>If he and Sandy weren’t rescued by morning, would
they ever be rescued?</p>

<p class='c015'>But we will be, Ken told himself. Everything will
work out the way it should. The police would notify
Richard Holt when they found his name scribbled on
the bills, and Ken’s father would drive the investigation
forward at top speed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“By noon—by afternoon at the latest,” Ken kept repeating
to himself, “we’ll be free. And Grace and his
gang will be behind bars.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He wished he could signal his hope and confidence to
Sandy, but the effort seemed more than he could manage.
He ached in every muscle. His hands and feet were
beginning to pain agonizingly from the tight bonds.</p>

<p class='c015'>The minutes lengthened into hours. Ken had no idea
what time it was when Cal returned, looked at them
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>briefly, and went out again to pace back and forth on
the aft deck.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly there were sounds of men calling back and
forth. The barge lurched once, and seemed to shift. It
bumped into something with a solid thud.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken tried to heave himself into a sitting position, but
it was impossible. He began to grunt frantically.</p>

<p class='c015'>“M-O-V-I-N-G,” he spelled out.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy answered with one word. “Y-E-S.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was no need to try to say more. Both of them
realized that when—or if—the police came to the dock
the next morning in search of them the barge and its
captives would no longer be there.</p>

    <div>HEADING FOR DEEP WATERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>On the far side of the cabin wall something—a frying
pan, perhaps—began to bang rhythmically as it swung
back and forth. The barge was responding sluggishly
to the river swells, its tremendous weight of stone lending
it a stability that resisted the rise and fall of the
water.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s panic gave him strength. He heaved desperately
upward, trying to achieve a sitting position.
His head struck the low ceiling with a resounding crack.
He fell back, half stunned.</p>

<p class='c015'>Labored dots and dashes, in the form of grunts, came
quickly up from below him. “Y-O-U O-K?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken managed to answer. “O-K.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Finally he forced himself to try again. He had been
almost upright once. If he didn’t heave quite so far—</p>

<p class='c015'>He was sitting up finally and hunching himself forward
until his head was even with a window set in the
wall midway along the bunk. The gap between the curtains
was wide enough to let him peer out.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>There were lights in the distance. But close to the
barge everything was in darkness. He could see nothing.</p>

<p class='c015'>The cabin door began to open and Ken let himself
fall back on the bunk.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal came in, lighted the kerosene lamp, and then
came over to the bunks.</p>

<p class='c015'>With a single jerk he ripped the adhesive from Ken’s
mouth, and then bent to do the same for Sandy.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s so you can say your prayers,” he told them
with a laugh. “Yell ’em out loud if you want to. Nobody’s
going to hear you now.” He seemed enormously
amused at the idea.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken worked his jaws a moment. He felt as if Cal had
ripped off several layers of skin along with the tape.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal was pouring himself a cup of coffee from his apparently
bottomless pot.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where are we going?” Ken asked evenly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where are <i>you</i> going?” Cal threw back his head to
laugh again. “Well, now, there’s lots of answers to that
question.” He took a long swallow of coffee. “Sailors
sometimes call it Davy Jones’s locker. Other folks have
different names for it. But whatever you call it, it’s
mighty wet and a long way down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then, still laughing, he finished the coffee and went
back outside, slamming the door heavily behind himself.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s lying,” Sandy said quickly, from the lower
bunk.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure,” Ken agreed. “Remember when Dad was talking
about counterfeiters that day at the office? He said
they usually printed a lot of bills at one time, before
they distributed any of it. Then, when they had all they
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>were going to make, they distributed it all over the
country at one clip—and by that time their printing
equipment and everything else was dismantled and
scattered. So even if the bills were identified, there
was nothing that would tie the counterfeiters up to
them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure. I remember,” Sandy said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So all they’re probably going to do with us is get us
safely out of the way some place, until they’re finished
with their production and ready to clear out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s right.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But Ken himself hadn’t been convinced by what he
said. And he knew that Sandy didn’t believe it either.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal had been telling the truth. They both knew that.</p>

<p class='c015'>The wind sighed gustily along the cabin walls, but
otherwise the little room was silent for a long moment.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where do you suppose these barges go?” Ken asked
finally.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Who knows?” Sandy, too, managed to conceal the
panic in his voice. “Up the East River to Long Island
Sound—across the bay to Staten Island—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s heart jumped. Maybe Cal was lying after all.
“Not out to sea?” he asked. To drown them in the open
sea might be comparatively safe. But if the barges
stayed as close inshore as Sandy had suggested, drowning
would be too risky. A body would wash ashore. Investigation
would follow immediately.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They <i>can</i> go out to sea,” Sandy admitted slowly.
“They go down the coast to Baltimore sometimes—and
up to Boston too, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>With an effort he forced his brain to work. “You’ve
sailed out of New York Harbor,” he said. “How long
would it take us to be towed out to deep water—in case
we are leaving the harbor and heading for the ocean.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Depends on which way the tide’s running,” Sandy
said, “and what kind of a tug they’ve got on the job.
From what we saw on the pier earlier, I’d say all three
of the barges are being towed at once—anyway, they
all had the same cargo. That’s quite a load. Ought to
take four or five hours, I’d guess.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What are our chances of signaling one of the other
barges from here?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Small,” Sandy answered briefly. “It would have been
possible shortly after we left the pier,” he went on, “but
the towlines are lengthened pretty quickly, especially
in dirty weather. We may already be a couple of hundred
feet from the barge, and falling behind fast. And
there’s nothing back of us,” he reminded Ken. “This was
the last barge tied up at the pier—counting from the
seaward end of the line.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I know.” Suddenly Ken heaved himself up again to
a sitting position. All his aches and his weariness were
temporarily forgotten in the desperate need for action.
“So in that case,” he said, “we’d better see if we can’t
get out of this cabin while there’s still a chance of yelling
for help. If the next barge is only two hundred
yards away—”</p>

<p class='c015'>But Sandy had interrupted him. “Just how had you
figured on doing that?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hadn’t—yet,” Ken admitted. “But together we
ought to be able to think of something. We’ve got two
brains between us—and I doubt if Cal has more than
half a one himself.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>“My brain’s not working tonight,” Sandy mumbled.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken heard the dead note of despair in his voice.
“Look,” he said hastily, “how much of the time will we
be alone in here? What are Cal’s duties on this tub?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy’s answer was reluctant, as if he really were
incapable of thought—or believed it to be entirely
futile. “They don’t amount to much,” he said finally.
“He makes sure the lines are secure. Makes sure the
running lights are in working order. Checks the bilges
and starts the pump if the water in the hold gets too
deep. Generally I guess he just sits in here by the fire.”</p>

<p class='c015'>At that moment, as if to prove Sandy’s words, Cal
came in again. He looked over at them briefly, his thick
lip curved in its usual sneer. Then he shook the stove
into life, refilled his enamel mug with coffee once more,
and settled down in the comfortable chair he had occupied
earlier that evening. Deliberately he opened up
his newspaper.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken clenched his teeth. They couldn’t even discuss
the possibilities of escape with Cal sitting there on
guard.</p>

<p class='c015'>In a sudden frenzy he strained at the bonds around
his wrists. But even if his hands hadn’t been already
numb, he knew instantly he couldn’t break the cord if
he struggled over it for a year. The rope around his
crossed ankles was equally strong and equally secure.</p>

<p class='c015'>He could feel the bunk under him jerk as Sandy
shifted his weight, and knew that Sandy too had been
making the same useless attempt.</p>

<p class='c015'>The coal in the stove crackled softly. Outside, the
spray beat against the walls. Time dragged by endlessly.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>Suddenly Ken’s body jarred against the wall of the
bunk. He came to, blinking, and realized that despite
the tautness of his nerves he had been exhausted
enough to sleep. As he twisted himself away from the
wall his eyes fell on a clock he hadn’t noticed before,
high on the opposite wall. It said five o’clock.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken instantly was wide awake. Five o’clock! Then
they had been underway for a long time.</p>

<p class='c015'>He felt the motion of the barge beneath him. It was
no longer a steady forward drive. It was an up-and-down
heave. And spray was now lashing frequently
against door and windows.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken knew the barge had left the shelter of the shore.
It was nearing the open sea.</p>

<p class='c015'>His eyes flew to Cal. The man was still seated at the
table. He had finished his newspaper and was reading a
magazine, his lips forming the words as his eyes followed
the lines.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sandy,” Ken said softly. “You awake?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal’s eyes flicked toward the bunks and then away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m awake.” Sandy’s voice was dull. He sounded
beaten. He, too, realized their predicament—and he,
too, was helpless to fight it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly Ken was swept by an anger that overcame
his fear and despair. He lunged toward the edge of the
bunk.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I didn’t want to give away too much back there in
the shop last night,” he said loudly, hurling his voice
against Cal’s bent head, “but I wasn’t kidding when I
said the police know about what’s going on there.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>He hoped the lying words would be truth within a
matter of hours—that soon, following the trail of torn
bills, the police would be on the hunt for the counterfeiters.
It seemed impossible that they could locate the
barge in time to do the boys any good. But, Ken
thought, if he could disturb Cal’s sneering calm—even
for a moment—it would be worth it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They’ve probably got Grace and Barrack right now,”
he went on. “And if you think those two are going to
take the rap when they can pin it all on you—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Shut up!” Cal said, without looking up. “You’re
wasting your time. And you’re talking through your
hat.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You think the police don’t know about the forced
entry into my father’s apartment?” Ken went on.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was a shot in the dark, but surprisingly it paid off.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That wasn’t me,” Cal growled, “and nobody can
prove it was!” He glared at Ken.</p>

<p class='c015'>The small triumph was like a jolt of adrenalin pouring
through Ken’s veins.</p>

<p class='c015'>“They know about the illegal entry into the Allen
house in Brentwood, too,” he said tauntingly, testing
his luck a little farther.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That wasn’t me either! They—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken couldn’t hear the rest of it. His ears were suddenly
filled with a thudding roar.</p>

<p class='c015'>It wasn’t spray that had hit the wall of the cabin that
time. It was solid water—tons and heavy tons of it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal staggered to his feet, grabbed a suit of oilskins
and a pair of rubber boots out of a cupboard, flung
them on, and dashed out of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good,” Sandy said. “He’s going to be busy for a
while. Now we can get busy ourselves. I’ve been thinking.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>“Yes?” Ken wished he could see Sandy’s face.</p>

<p class='c015'>But before Sandy could answer, Cal came into the
room again. A sheet of spray came with him, to hiss and
steam where it struck the hot stove.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal shoved the door shut and leaned against it for a
moment, panting, before he crossed the room to take a
kerosene lantern from a shelf. When he had lighted it
he left again immediately, fighting his way outside
against wind-blown spray that seemed bent on flooding
the cabin.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy picked up where he had left off. “That door
opens inward against the foot of the bunks. If I could
turn around on this bunk so that I was behind the door
when Cal opens it, and if I could kick it back against
him when he was already in the room, he ought to be
pretty well knocked out by the blow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Knocked outside the cabin, you mean?” Ken was
trying to visualize what Sandy described. It sounded
like a dubious possibility.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He might be,” Sandy agreed. “That would be all
right too, if it just put him out of commission for a
while. But what I hope is that if we time it right we
can drive him against the opposite wall. Then I think
we ought to be able to get rid of these lassos we’re
wearing. All we need is plenty of time and some kind
of tools.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was still mulling over the scheme Sandy had
outlined. “He’d have to come all the way to the edge
of the door—that far into the room—and then stop
there a minute.” His voice raised a notch. “And he’d do
just that if I were lying right there on the floor in front
of him.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>“You?” Sandy’s question reminded Ken of his position
on the upper bunk, up under the roof. “How would you
get down there without breaking your neck?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The barge lurched sickeningly. The entire cabin
shook as a heavy wave struck the rear bulwark. The
coffeepot fell from the stove with a loud clatter and
rolled across the floor.</p>

<p class='c015'>“On the other hand,” Sandy said quietly, when the
blow subsided for a moment, “there are worse things
than risking your neck.” He paused for a moment. “You
hear something?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken listened. “Yes! An engine! Could it be the engine
of—?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s the pumping engine,” Sandy said grimly. “He’s
started it up. We must be shipping water.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh.” Ken’s momentary hope that it might be the
engine of a rescue craft died hard. But he tried to fight
off his disappointment. “Good,” he said. “It’ll keep him
busy awhile. Give us time to get ready.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Maybe,” Sandy said. “Or maybe it means we have
less time than we thought. If it’s really as tough out
there as it sounds, the tugboat captain may decide to
turn back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I see,” Ken said. His throat felt suddenly tight and
he swallowed. “And if he decides to turn around, Cal
would have to give up the idea of waiting for really
deep water. He’d do—what he’s supposed to do to us—right
away.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>“But that doesn’t mean we can’t try your scheme,
Sandy,” Ken said after a moment. “It just means we
have to speed up the schedule.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s what it means,” Sandy said. He laughed
grimly. “I’ve got no feeling in my legs. My arms are
numb to the elbow. I’ve got about as much chance of
standing up as I have of—” He broke off, and Ken
could hear him edging over on the bunk. “But I might
as well try,” he concluded.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken moved until he could see over the rim of his own
bunk. “Why stand up? All you have to do is turn around
on the bunk.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve got to get you down,” Sandy muttered. “If you
try it by yourself you’ll probably break your neck in the
drop.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy had flung his legs sideways and was lowering
his bound feet to the floor. Because his ankles were
crossed he could put only one foot flat on the floor at a
time. He leaned forward, pushing himself with the
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>hands tied behind his back. He waited until the barge
was momentarily on an even keel and then forced one
foot to take his weight.</p>

<p class='c015'>The leg was numb. It collapsed immediately. Sandy
barely managed to fling himself back into the bunk, to
save himself from toppling forward onto his face.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken could feel sweat tickling his own forehead.</p>

<p class='c015'>Outside, the pumping engine coughed. It spit, missed
fire, caught again, and then died.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hear that?” Ken’s voice was as cheerful as he could
make it. “Cal’s having a little trouble.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy was on the edge of the bunk, ready to try
again. But he held himself still to listen. “He’d better
get that engine going before too long,” he muttered.
He pushed his foot against the floor and once more the
leg crumpled.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Try beating your foot on the floor,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy raised his legs and lowered them, thumping
first one foot and then the other against the floor.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What’s all the hurry—about the engine, I mean?”
Ken asked, in an effort to distract Sandy’s attention
from the knifelike pains that he knew must be shooting
through the redhead’s feet and legs. “Barges don’t
really need to be pumped out, do they? You couldn’t
sink them if you tried, could you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure they sink,” Sandy grunted, “if they get enough
water aboard.” He gave one last thump and then
again tried his weight on his foot.</p>

<p class='c015'>His knees buckled, but with a desperate effort he
straightened up and wedged his broad shoulders
against the upper bunk. He braced himself there for a
moment, his face contorted with pain.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>The barge tilted, lifting its forward end as if the entire
Atlantic were piling up under it, thrusting it skyward.
Sandy’s shoulders began to slide along the bunk,
his poorly balanced body tilting sideways.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken twisted swiftly and thrust his legs out over the
edge of the bunk, holding them stiff with all his
strength. Sandy slid against them. For a moment Ken
thought the redhead’s weight would push them aside,
and that Sandy would fall past them to the floor. But
just as Ken realized that he could no longer bear the
strain, the barge reached the peak of its upward lift
and began to tilt the other way. Sandy’s body slowly
righted itself.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now,” Sandy said, “I’m—”</p>

<p class='c015'>The pumping engine coughed and started. The boys
froze. If it began to work smoothly again, Cal would
certainly not remain outside in the driving wind and
weather.</p>

<p class='c015'>Just then the engine sputtered several times and died
again.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Quick!” Sandy said. “Maybe the next time he’ll make
it. Force your knees apart and bring your legs down
over my head. I’ll set you down pickaback.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You can’t!” Ken told him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come on. Stop arguing.” Sandy barked the words.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were times, Ken knew, when Sandy’s stubbornness
was like a rock. This was apparently one of
those times.</p>

<p class='c015'>He lifted his legs above Sandy’s head, forcing them
apart at the knees until they formed the facing halves
of a diamond. The movement was agony.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>Sandy ducked his head and brought it up between
Ken’s legs, so that Ken’s crossed ankles thrust themselves
out before his chin.</p>

<p class='c015'>Again the engine coughed into life, sputtered, and
died. A wave struck the barge’s aft bulwark, and shattered
into spray which rattled against the cabin like a
hail of machine-gun bullets.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Throw yourself forward,” Sandy ordered, “and hope
for the best. If I go down try to protect your head.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken took a deep breath. Suddenly his perch, five
feet above the floor, seemed atop a skyscraper.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Get ready,” he muttered. “Here goes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He leaned back and then lunged forward, his weight
shoving Sandy clear of the bunk. The redhead’s foot
slid on the tilting floor, his legs buckling. His shoulders
jerked to the right. He was fighting with everything he
had to keep himself steady.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hang on!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c015'>A single grunt of pain escaped him as he dropped
forward onto his knees, striking the floor with a bone-jarring
crash.</p>

<p class='c015'>For a moment he knelt almost upright, balanced by
a fortunate roll of the barge. Then he slumped sideways,
no longer able to bear Ken’s weight on his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c015'>They sprawled in a tangle, Ken’s legs still fastened
around Sandy’s neck, their chests heaving, their bodies
aching.</p>

<p class='c015'>Outside, the engine started again. The throb of its
exhaust, muffled by the sound of wind and water,
seemed steady.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>Sandy groaned. “He’ll be coming back in! Get going!
Get off my neck!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken tugged and Sandy squirmed and wriggled. Finally
Ken was free. With a burst of frenzied strength he
managed to roll over on his stomach and shove himself
upward to his knees. Then he began to inch his way
over the floor to the place in front of the door—the spot
where they wanted Cal to stop.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy had also gotten to his knees in front of the
bunk. He waited, panting, until the barge heaved in
the right direction, and then threw himself over the
edge of the lower bunk, squirming and fighting until
he was on it again.</p>

<p class='c015'>When they were both in place, Ken said, “I’ll have to
tell you exactly when to kick the door shut. You won’t
be able to see him, once it’s open. When I yell, you let
drive.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy didn’t answer for a minute. When he did, his
voice was low and jerky. “It’s no use, Ken. I wouldn’t
be able to kick a ping-pong ball now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Cut that out!” Ken said sharply. “You’ll do it all
right. When you’ve had a minute’s rest. Listen! The engine’s
stopped again! Now he’s got to work on it some
more. Just relax until he comes in. Take deep breaths.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A wash of solid water struck the side of the cabin,
and water began to ooze in under the door, forming a
slowly widening puddle. The kerosene lamp in its wall
bracket flickered as a gust of cold wet wind rattled the
windows and penetrated inside.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>Sandy was lying perfectly still on his back, his legs
hanging over the side of the bunk. Ken watched him
tensely. Finally Sandy gave a long, shuddering sigh.
Then he lifted his head slightly to take a sight on the
door, shifted his body a few inches, and slowly brought
his knees up toward his chest. If he thrust them out
they would strike the outer edge of the door as it was
flung open.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s own sigh of relief came all the way from his
numb and nerveless toes. Sandy was going to be all
right.</p>

<p class='c015'>“This look O.K. to you?” Sandy muttered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Just right,” Ken told him. “Perfect.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I won’t be able to hold this position for very
long. And if I let my legs down—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No! Don’t do that!” Ken said urgently. “We won’t
get any warning. He’ll just burst in when he comes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The engine started up once more.</p>

<p class='c015'>“See?” Ken said. “It’s going again. Any second
now—”</p>

<p class='c015'>He broke off and listened intently. There was a lull
in the storm, and in the unexpected quiet they could
hear the pumping engine ticking smoothly away. They
could even hear the gurgle of water spouting out of its
pipe.</p>

<p class='c015'>A long minute passed, and then another. Ken
watched Sandy, and his heart thudded in sympathy.
Sometimes Sandy’s legs would sink forward and down,
and Ken would catch his breath. But Sandy always
pulled them back again, the muscles of his neck drawn
tight with the effort.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’ll be here any second,” Ken repeated. “The
pump sounds steady as a watch now.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>With a rush the wind came back again, throwing a
ton of water against the side wall.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He won’t stay out in this if he doesn’t have to,” Ken
said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy’s feet suddenly crashed to the floor.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sandy!” Ken’s voice snapped like a whip. “Get them
up! He might—”</p>

<p class='c015'>They both heard Cal’s heavy body lunge against the
wall near the door, thrust off balance by the wind.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He’s coming! Sandy!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy’s feet came up from the floor slowly, inch by
inch, and his knees bent back toward his chest.</p>

<p class='c015'>And then the door started to open, and a heavy rubber
boot stepped over the threshold.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s view of Sandy was immediately cut off. He had
no idea whether Sandy would be able to get into position
in time or not—or whether he had the strength
left to get into position again at all.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal’s whole body was in the room now, his right hand
pushing the door wide ahead of him. Water streamed
down his face. He brushed it out of his eyes with the
left hand and caught sight of Ken, near his feet. Instinctively
he leaned forward over Ken’s prone body.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now!” Ken shouted.</p>

<p class='c015'>The heavy door traveled only six inches before it
struck its crouching target. But those six inches were
enough. Somewhere Sandy had found the strength to
put his whole weight behind the push.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal’s body zoomed sideways. The force of the drive
had knocked him off his feet like a bowling ball hitting
a tenpin. His arms flailed as he fought for balance. His
mouth opened on a shout.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>But the shout was never uttered. Cal flew across the
cabin, missing the stove by inches. His head crashed
against the far wall with a thud that jarred loose a
frying pan hanging above the stove. The clang of metal
on metal was still echoing in the little room when Cal’s
whole big body collapsed in an inert heap.</p>

<p class='c015'>The door banged shut.</p>

<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>WITH THE HELP OF FIRE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“You did it!” Ken’s exultant shout broke the spell of
silence that had fallen on the cabin.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It looks like it.” Sandy laughed shakily. “Now all we
have to do is get these ropes off before he comes to
again.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If we could find a knife I could back up to you and
hack through the ones on your wrists,” Ken said, his
eyes traveling rapidly over the room. “There must be
one here somewhere. He has meals on board.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But there was no knife visible. There was no drawer
in the table where one might be found. Their survey
of the room revealed that the only place in the cabin
which might conceal a knife was the row of cupboards
high on the rear wall.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think I could pull the doors of those things open
with my teeth, if I were standing up,” Sandy decided.
“Anyway, it’s worth a try. Can you see to it that Cal
goes on slumbering comfortably while I’m at it?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>Ken thought a moment. Bound as he was, it was unlikely
that he could knock Cal out again if the man
began to revive.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t know,” he muttered. “Even if I sat on him,
he’s big enough to throw me off. I’ve got it! I know
how to take care of him. You go ahead, Sandy—if
you’ve got the strength to move.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy was still breathing heavily. “I’m O.K.,” he said.
“I seem to have got my second wind.” He began once
more to work himself off the bunk.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken wriggled over to the armless wooden chair beside
the kitchen table and began to shove it laboriously
along the floor toward Cal. The man lay on his back,
his head a few feet from the wall against which he had
been knocked out. His sou’wester had fallen off, and
an egg-shaped bump was beginning to swell up almost
in the center of his crown.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken managed to get the chair between Cal’s body
and the wall, and then shoved it forward until its legs
straddled the man’s head.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now if I can just climb up on the chair,” Ken explained
to Sandy, “with my feet on his chest, I’ll be
able to give him a solid thump on the chin with my
heels if he begins to stir. And if he tries to sit up suddenly
he ought to knock himself out again by hitting
the bottom of the chair seat.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy, who had managed to maneuver himself to a
spot just beneath the high cupboards, sent Ken a congratulatory
grin. “Brain conquers brawn again,” he
said. “Good work. Do you need a boost up onto the
chair?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll make it—somehow,” Ken told him.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>He struggled to his knees alongside the chair, maintaining
a precarious balance by swinging his bound
hands behind his back. Then he tried to jerk himself
back and up, onto his bound feet. But his numb ankles
gave way and he pitched forward on his knees again
with an agonizing thump.</p>

<p class='c015'>In almost the same moment Sandy, who was also
trying to hoist himself into an erect position in front
of the cupboards, toppled forward in a similar defeat.</p>

<p class='c015'>After an instant’s silence each of them asked the same
question. “You O.K.?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure,” Sandy said, past clenched teeth.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure,” Ken echoed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken edged himself into position once more, his chest
almost touching the side of the chair. He took a deep
breath.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wait for the roll,” Sandy said. “It’s coming.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The barge dipped. Ken used all his energy in an attempt
to straighten his knees. He got halfway up. For
a second he seemed suspended in mid-air. Then his
knees began to buckle. With a last desperate effort he
twisted around. When he fell he hit the very edge of
the chair and hung there, his body in a long slant that
touched the chair seat midway between his hips and
his knees. Almost immediately he began to slide downward
as the barge reversed its tilt.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken threw his head far back. His bound hands scrabbled
for a hold on the slippery wood. With all his
might he pushed his heels against the floor, trying to
hold his position against the pull of the deck beneath
him.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was fighting a losing battle when the barge
reached the depth of its dive and began to climb.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>Slowly, a fraction of an inch at a time, he moved
backward onto the seat of the chair.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’re almost on!” Across the room Sandy had abandoned
his own efforts for a moment in his anxiety over
Ken. “Push!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken gave one final shove and then let his breath out
with a gasp. He had made it! He slumped against the
chair back, his chest rising and falling with the gulps
of air he was sucking into his lungs.</p>

<p class='c015'>After a moment he swung his feet up off the floor and
onto Cal’s chest. They landed some six inches from
Cal’s chin.</p>

<p class='c015'>“O.K.,” Ken said. “He’s under control. One little
backward jerk and I can subdue any ambitions he
might develop. The only trouble is I can’t see his face.
So give me a signal if you see him beginning to open
his eyes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It will be a pleasure,” Sandy assured him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then the redhead returned to his own problem. The
cupboard knobs were more than five feet above the
floor. There was no way to reach them without standing
up.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy made one more gigantic effort to thrust himself
upright from his knees.</p>

<p class='c015'>For an instant he seemed to have succeeded. And
then the barge gave an unexpected sideways lurch and
Sandy fell heavily on his side.</p>

<p class='c015'>He lay there perfectly still, his eyes shut in a face
that looked startlingly white in the flickering light of
the lamp.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>“Sandy!” Ken jerked forward involuntarily but
caught himself just before he lost his hard-won position
on the chair. “Sandy!” he repeated urgently. “Are
you—?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy opened one eye. “I’m—all right,” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c015'>He raised his head slightly and his mouth tightened
with pain.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I think I must have twisted my ankle a little
when I fell,” he went on after a moment. “I don’t think
I can put my weight on it for a while, even if I could
get upright.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t try it,” Ken said quickly. “You’re going to be
no help if you’re knocked out.” His eyes searched the
room frantically. “There must be <i>something</i> around
here we can use to get out of these ropes.” His
voice lifted suddenly. “Maybe Cal’s got a knife in his
pocket!”</p>

<p class='c015'>He leaned forward instinctively toward the body
beneath him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t get off the chair!” Sandy said quickly. “I’ll
come over.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Again hope seemed to have given him new strength.
Slowly at first, and then a little faster, he squirmed his
way over the floor. Sitting down near Cal, with his back
toward the unconscious man, his bound hands began
to fumble with the fastenings of Cal’s oilskins.</p>

<p class='c015'>Five minutes went by, and then ten more, before
Sandy had explored every pocket in the man’s clothes.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nothing,” he said. “I guess we’re—” A slight movement
caught his glance.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal’s eyelid was fluttering. His head turned.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ken!” Sandy said quickly. “He’s coming to!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken jerked his heels backward. They smacked against
Cal’s chin.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>Sandy bent forward for a careful look. “All right,”
he said. “You’ve taken care of him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Neither of them spoke for a moment.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ve done the hardest part,” Ken finally burst out.
“We’ve got Cal out of the way. Don’t tell me we’re
stuck now!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy didn’t answer.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you suppose I could chew through those ropes
on your wrists?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy grinned faintly. “In about three days, maybe—if
they were well boiled first, to tenderize them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But there must be—” Ken broke off. “Listen!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Listen to what?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The pump’s not running!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy concentrated, his head nodding slowly. The
reassuring chug of the gasoline engine was no longer
audible.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How long ago do you think it happened?” Sandy
asked quickly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t know. I just noticed it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy’s eyes sought the clock.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Almost eight,” he muttered. A glance at the window
told him that the hour was correct. The grayness outside
would have been daylight if the weather were less
stormy. “We’re probably pretty well out to sea,” Sandy
said. “So the weather will be getting worse, if anything.
A while ago we were afraid they’d turn back. Now....”
His voice sank to a whisper.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’re not licked yet,” Ken said stubbornly. “We
can’t be—not as long as this thing is still afloat and
we’re still conscious.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>The barge shuddered as another solid wave poured
over the bulwark and struck the cabin. The water
seeping in under the door was coming faster now.</p>

<p class='c015'>“As long as this thing is still afloat,” Sandy repeated,
and shrugged. “That might not be long at this rate.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But if we’re really in trouble,” Ken said, “the barge
up ahead will be able to tell—now that it’s getting
light.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They may be able to tell,” Sandy agreed, “though I
doubt if they can even see us in this weather. But
there’s not much they can do about it except cut our
towline if it looks as if this tub were really going down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Would they do that?” Ken sounded incredulous.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What else could they do?” Sandy asked. “You
couldn’t expect them to hold on and be carried down
with us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken swallowed. “We could always go overboard—with
something to hang on to. Any piece of wood—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure,” Sandy said. “And how long do you think
we’d last in this kind of a sea—even with something to
keep us afloat—when we’re trussed up like this?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mean,” Ken said slowly, “that unless we get
that pump going there’s really a chance that—?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy didn’t wait for him to finish. “That’s just what
I mean. The more water she ships,” he explained carefully,
in a colorless voice, “the deeper she rides. And
the deeper she rides, the more water she takes. It’s
what’s known as a vicious circle.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Crash! That time the water dove full over the cabin
roof, pouring down the walls in solid sheets.</p>

<p class='c015'>How many like that, Ken wondered, would it take
to fill the barge to its gunwales and drag it under?
How soon—?</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>But all thought blanked out of his mind as the barge
careened far to one side. Ken fought to retain his
place, digging his heels into Cal’s rocklike chest.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy, with nothing to brace himself against, slid
helplessly across the floor toward the hotly glowing
stove.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sandy!” Ken shouted. “Watch out!”</p>

<p class='c015'>But Sandy couldn’t check his headlong dive. His
shoulder struck hot metal.</p>

<p class='c015'>Even as he hit it he was twisting away, with all the
strength of his muscles. But the smell of burned cloth
quickly filled the air. And as Sandy managed to lunge
himself toward the wall, and safety, Ken could see the
charred black burn on the sleeve of his windbreaker.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Did it go through?” Ken asked. “Are you burned?”</p>

<p class='c015'>To his amazement Sandy’s answering voice was suddenly
strong—almost cheerful.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I just got warmed up,” he said. He twisted around
so that Ken could see his face. “We’ll beat this thing
yet, Ken.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken stared at him. The thought popped into his head
that Sandy’s mind might be wandering. A moment ago
he had sounded completely beaten. Now Sandy was
edging back toward the stove.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What are you doing?” Ken demanded. “Sandy,
stop!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let me alone. I’m burning to get out of these
things.” He lay down on his back in front of the stove
and started to lift his legs into the air. “I’m not going to
risk working on the ropes around my wrists,” he said.
“Too tricky. I couldn’t see what I was doing and I
might put my hands out of commission. And I’ll need
’em when we get out there to work that pump. But the
ones around my ankles—”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>Ken’s heart had stopped pounding in panic. In a
sudden flash he had realized what Sandy was planning
to do. He was going to burn through the ropes that
bound his feet together.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Can I help?” Ken leaned forward. “Maybe if I—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” Sandy grunted. “You stay where you are. But
keep an eye on me. I can’t see very well from down
here.” His feet were above the top of the stove now,
and Sandy was lowering them carefully so that the
ropes were directly above the metal edge. “How’m I
doing?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Looks good from here. But be careful!”</p>

<p class='c015'>New life sounded in both their voices now.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a low sizzling sound. The ropes had become
damp from the water on the floor. Then again a
scorching smell filled the cabin.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ouch!” Sandy yanked his legs away. “Too close that
time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Once more he got into position. Once more the
scorching smell rose from the vicinity of the stove.</p>

<p class='c015'>“One strand gone,” Sandy muttered a few minutes
later. He winced and jerked his feet upward but immediately
lowered them again.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken winced in sympathy.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There goes another one!” Sandy announced.</p>

<p class='c015'>And suddenly his feet were free. The cord that had
bound them lay in smoking tendrils on the floor.</p>

    <div>ROBBED BY THE WAVES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Sandy lay sprawled on one side. His forehead was
damp with sweat, but he was already rubbing one
ankle gently against the other in an effort to restore
circulation.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Feels as if someone were poking hot needles in my
feet,” he said. “But don’t get me wrong,” he added.
“I’m not complaining.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you burned much?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not enough to worry about,” Sandy assured him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, here goes,” he said a moment later. He drew
his right knee up beneath him and, using that knee and
his right shoulder and elbow as points of leverage, he
shoved himself up to his knees, keeping them wide
apart so that he could balance against the roll of the
barge. Then he dragged his left foot forward and put
it flat on the floor, so that he was resting on one knee
and one foot.</p>

<p class='c015'>He tried pushing against that foot, to bring himself
erect, but the ankle gave way as soon as he put any
weight on it.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>“Ouch!” he muttered, and rested a minute, wriggling
his foot to bring the painful muscles back to life.</p>

<p class='c015'>He tried it twice more. And then suddenly he was on
his feet. He had to lean against the table in order to
stay upright, but the grime-streaked face beneath the
red hair looked grimly jubilant.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look at me,” he said. “I’m standing! Never thought
it would feel like such an achievement.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken grinned. “No hands, too. Now let’s see if you
can walk over to that cupboard and find a knife.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Unsteadily, and wincing at every step from the pains
shooting up his legs, Sandy made it to the cupboard
wall. He waited there a moment, until the barge was
on a comparatively even keel, and then he clamped his
teeth on the knob of the first door and jerked his head
back. The door flew open, almost knocking him backward,
and a shower of objects came tumbling out,
bouncing from Sandy’s chest to the floor.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy looked down at them. “Nothing but food,” he
muttered disgustedly. “Flour, peanut butter, noodles....”</p>

<p class='c015'>“When we’ve got more time,” Ken said, “I’ll remember
to laugh at the sight of you complaining at the appearance
of food. But right now I’m more interested in
the next cupboard. Try again.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy braced himself as the barge twisted in a corkscrew
dive. Then he closed his teeth around the knob
of the next cupboard and pulled that one open. A row
of cups hanging on hooks swayed violently with the
movement of the barge, and small piles of plates and
saucers would have flown into the room except for the
guard rails that held them in place. Sandy’s glance fell
on a flat traylike box on the upper shelf, above the level
of his eye.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>Ken saw it too. “That’s it!” he said excitedly. “It’s
just like the box Mom keeps knives and forks in—in a
drawer in the kitchen table. Can you get it down?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m certainly not going to leave it there,” Sandy told
him.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was one other chair in the cabin, besides the
one that Ken was using. Sandy hooked a foot over one
rung and dragged it along the floor, hopping painfully
on the other foot. When the chair was beneath the
cupboard he crawled up onto it, straightened up, and
gave a shout of triumph.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Plenty of knives!”</p>

<p class='c015'>But the cupboard shelf was too shallow for him to
poke his head in and pick one knife up with his teeth.
After pondering for a moment Sandy finally clamped
his teeth over the edge of the box, turned around,
jumped down from the chair and made it to the table
just as the box tilted forward. There was a rattle of
cutlery on the floor, but there were still several pieces
of battered kitchenware inside when the box thudded
to the table.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy grinned, massaging his aching jaw muscles
against one shoulder. “I feel like a retriever,” he said,
bending over to study the contents of his prize.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good doggie,” Ken applauded. “What luck?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“One knife coming up,” Sandy assured him. He
turned his back to the box and felt among the contents
with his bound hands until he located the object he
had noted there.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>As soon as Ken could see what Sandy was holding
he said, “Great! A paring knife. Now let’s hope it’s
sharp. Stick the handle between my teeth and hold
your hands in front of me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The barge dipped sickeningly and Sandy braced himself
against the table to avoid being thrown. Ken leaned
back hard against his chair. There was a heavy thud as
a wall of water swept over the stern and struck the
rear wall of the cabin. The pool in the middle of the
room was widening fast.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come on,” Ken said. “Hurry up.” He dreaded thinking
how long it was going to take him to free Sandy’s
hands. The pump had already been out of operation for
some time. How much water had the barge taken on
already? How much more could it stand?</p>

<p class='c015'>He closed his mind to the questions as the barge settled,
and twisted sideways on the chair so that Sandy
could get close to him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy got into position, back toward Ken, who
reached forward and took the handle of the knife between
his teeth, blade downward.</p>

<p class='c015'>“A little closer. Up a couple of inches,” Ken mumbled
between clenched jaws. “Good. Hold it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He moved his head rhythmically back and forth,
drawing the blade of the knife across the tough cord.
Sandy held himself rigid, his legs spread for balance
against the roll of the deck. The muscles in his arms
and shoulders bulged with the effort of holding his
hands in place.</p>

<p class='c015'>Finally one strand parted. But Cal had done his job
well. Each loop was independently tied. Ken kept on.
His eyes ached under the strain of trying to focus on
the rope a scant few inches from his nose.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>Another loop parted. And then a third. And then a
fourth.</p>

<p class='c015'>The knife clattered to the floor. Ken sank back, exhausted.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s one more to go,” Ken gasped.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wait a minute.” Sandy took a deep breath, bent his
head, and hunched his shoulder muscles. He gave one
powerful tug. The last rope snapped. His hands were
free.</p>

<p class='c015'>He stood motionless for a moment, panting. Then he
began to knead his fingers to get the numbness out of
them. As soon as he could pick up the knife—and without
bothering to massage the painful welts on his wrists—he
went to work on Ken.</p>

<p class='c015'>A few quick strokes were enough to free Ken’s hands.
And then his feet were free too.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll be tying Cal up while you get enough life back
into your feet to be able to stand on them,” Sandy said
quickly. “Rub your hands too. We’ve got work to do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy turned Cal over on his face on the wet floor,
ripped off the man’s belt and used it to tie his hands
behind him, as the boys had been tied.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here,” Ken said. He had to use both his hands—his
fingers were still nerveless—to take a limp dish towel
from a nail on the wall and bring it to Sandy. “This
will do for his feet.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy pulled off Cal’s heavy boots and bound his
feet together, ripping the towel into strips first to give
him the length he needed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your hands O.K.?” he asked when he had finished.</p>

<p class='c015'>“As good as yours, I guess. Do you know how to start
a pump?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>“First give me a hand with Cal,” Sandy said. “We’ll
put him up on the bunk before he drowns down here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I doubt if he’d do the same for us,” Ken muttered.
But he helped hoist Cal’s heavy body up to the lower
bunk Sandy had recently occupied.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Put on his oilskins,” Ken said then. “There ought to
be another suit around here too.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He found another rubber coat, sou’wester, and boots
in one of the still-unopened cupboards while Sandy
was getting into Cal’s storm clothes.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy listened intently for a moment before they
opened the door. “Wind’s coming from our rear,” he
said. “We’ll be in the thick of it out there on the aft
deck. So watch out for a big wave—and hang on to
something if you see one coming. Ready?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ready.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They stepped quickly out onto the heaving aft deck
and slammed the door shut behind them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Outside, they found themselves in an angry world.
All around them rose huge combers that seemed to be
racing toward the barge or away from it with express-train
speed. The foam-flecked water reflected the dirty
gray of the sky. There was no land in sight, and no
other craft. There was nothing but water—steep vicious
mountains of it that seemed at every moment in danger
of tumbling down upon the wallowing barge.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hang on! Here comes one!” The wind ripped
Sandy’s shout out of his mouth. He linked one arm
through Ken’s as he spoke and threw the other arm
around a massive iron bitt bolted to the deck.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>A ponderous wall of water was coming toward them
from the port quarter. The barge fought to rise with it,
her timbers groaning at every joint. But the creaking
craft, laden with stone and water, was too heavy to
climb to the top.</p>

<p class='c015'>The wave struck the stern, and the upper several
feet of it sluiced straight over the bulwark. It poured
over the boys, knocking their feet out from under
them.</p>

<p class='c015'>For long seconds they were submerged. Ken clung to
Sandy and the redhead clung to the bitt. Finally the
bulk of the deluge poured through the scuppers. Their
heads came above water, and then the rest of their
bodies. They lay gasping for breath.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy struggled up first. “All right?” he asked, hauling
Ken to his feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think so.” Ken had lost his sou’wester. Water
streamed down his face from his soaked hair.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Watch out for the next one,” Sandy warned, “while
I take a look at this engine.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The pumping machinery was housed in a small flat-topped
shed about the size of a large dog kennel. Sandy
dropped to his knees in front of it and unhooked the
side panel that opened downward on hinges. Ken stood
alongside, his eyes scanning the heaving waters that
surrounded them.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Looks dry!” Sandy yelled triumphantly. “I’ll try
her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He wrapped the starting rope around the pulley of
the two-cylinder air-cooled engine and gave it a jerk.
The engine turned over, but it didn’t start.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken leaned down and put his mouth to Sandy’s ear.
“How about gasoline? Got enough?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>Sandy unscrewed the cap of the tank. He poked his
hand down as far as he could and shook his head. He
had felt nothing but emptiness. Then he looked around
the inner wall of the engine house, spotted a measuring
stick, and thrust that down into the tank until it
touched the bottom.</p>

<p class='c015'>When he brought it up Ken could see that only the
bottom quarter-inch of the stick had touched liquid.</p>

<p class='c015'>He lifted his eyes from the stick barely in time to
shout “Here it comes!” Another massive wall of water
was about to crash down upon them.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was an even bigger wave than the one before. A
crushing weight of sea swept over the engine house, to
shatter into stinging spray against the rear bulkhead of
the cabin. For what seemed endless minutes there was
three feet of water piled on the deck, and when it
finally drained toward the sides it pulled the boys
along with brutal force. They were barely able to prevent
themselves from being sucked overboard.</p>

<p class='c015'>They pulled themselves wearily to their feet again
when the worst was over. The water was cold and the
air was colder still. Their lips were blue. Their teeth
chattered.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy rubbed his hands and blew on the fingers to
warm them up.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was looking at the engine house. The side panel
had been down when the wave struck.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Soaked!” Ken shouted, pointing to the engine.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy nodded grim agreement. “Have to dry it. Get
blanket—towel—anything.” He jerked his head toward
the cabin.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>Ken nodded. He took a quick look at the sea around
them and then made a dive for the cabin door. He was
out again in a moment with a heavy bath towel he had
found under the bunk.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy was no longer bent over the engine house. He
was trying to open the hasp of a small lean-to built
against the cabin wall.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gasoline!” he shouted. “I hope.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken nodded and set to work. Within a few minutes
he had dried the plugs and the wires of the engine.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy was still struggling with the rusted fastener.
When he looked over and saw Ken point to the engine,
with a gesture that said “It’s ready,” Sandy stepped
back and drove his foot at the door of the lean-to. It
cracked down the middle. Sandy struck it again and
the hasp flew off. The door sagged open on twisted
hinges. Sandy dropped to his knees and peered inside.</p>

<p class='c015'>When he straightened up again he held a five-gallon
can in his hand.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sandy!” Ken had time to shout only the single word,
and to clamp his fingers around the engine-house doorway.
He hadn’t noticed the huge wave approaching
until it broke over the bulwark and poured across the
deck in a smothering flood.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken saw Sandy go down and his big body swept
along in the grip of the water. Ken reached for him
blindly, his eyes pinned shut by the piercing spray. He
felt his fingers clutch a flailing oilskin-clothed arm, and
he hung on with all his strength.</p>

<p class='c015'>The water poured over them for what seemed an
endless length of time. Sandy’s weight dragged painfully,
threatening to pull Ken’s arm from its socket.</p>

<p class='c015'>And then again the water receded and they were left
on the sloshing deck.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>When Ken was able to move he found he had to
force his fingers open to free his grip on Sandy’s arm.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That was close,” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy choked and coughed. “Too close.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Ken noticed that Sandy’s hands were empty.
The gasoline can he had been carrying was no longer
in sight.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The gas—overboard!” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy shook his head, struggling to get to his feet.
“Don’t worry. Two more cans in there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“In where?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy’s eyes followed Ken’s and the color drained
out of his wet cold-reddened face.</p>

<p class='c015'>The lean-to had disappeared. Only a few shattered
boards marked the spot where it had stood before the
wave struck.</p>

    <div>THE IRON BOX AGAIN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Sandy looked at Ken, and then back at the spot where
the lean-to had stood. He seemed completely stunned
by the catastrophe which had overtaken them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s bloodless lips shaped the words. “That was our
last chance.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’re not licked yet,” Sandy shouted. “Come on
around the other side. I noticed something there—covered
by canvas. Maybe it’s a hand pump.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This time Ken couldn’t respond to the determined
hope in Sandy’s voice. But he obediently followed the
redhead around the cabin into the windy fury of the
cabin’s other side. There Sandy went down on his
knees beside a canvas-wrapped mound nestling against
the bulkhead.</p>

<p class='c015'>His fingers tore at the lashings without effect. The
ropes were frozen fast.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken roused himself out of his despair and exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Knife,” he said briefly, and fought his way around
the corner to the cabin door. When he came out he had
the paring knife in his hand.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>Sandy took it from him and hacked at the icebound
ropes until he could rip the canvas off.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It <i>is</i> a hand pump!” The wind threw his shout back
into his teeth.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy braced himself against the storm’s strength,
grabbed the pump handle, and began to move it back
and forth.</p>

<p class='c015'>It seemed a small weapon with which to fight the
vast quantities of water that must already have accumulated
in the barge, but Ken knew it was all they had.
He took up a position opposite Sandy and bent his
own back to the task.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly a stream of dirty water began jetting from
the outlet hole to splash on the deck.</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’s coming!” Sandy yelled. “Faster!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Back and forth, back and forth, they worked the
handle as rapidly as they could. When a big wave raced
over the aft bulwark and threatened to drown them,
they still hung onto the pump handle, and were working
it again the moment the receding water let them
breathe.</p>

<p class='c015'>Back and forth ... back and forth.... Under
their heavy oilskins their frozen bodies began to
warm up.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ten minutes went by, and then ten more. They were
becoming uncomfortably hot. Sweat mingled with the
salt spray on their faces. Their aching muscles cried for
rest. But they kept on. Back and forth ... back and
forth....</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly Ken knew that the agony of his parched
throat was one thing he could no longer bear.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Water,” he said. “I need water.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>Sandy answered without losing his rhythm. “Go
ahead. I’ll get some later.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The cabin was warm and peaceful and quiet. Ken
had to avoid passing near a chair, for fear he would
slump down on it and never rise again. He forced himself
to hurry, gulping his drink and turning back toward
the door the moment he had slaked his burning thirst.</p>

<p class='c015'>Back at the pump once more, he caught the rhythm
quickly. And it wasn’t so bad now, he thought. He must
be getting numb.</p>

<p class='c015'>Back and forth ... back and forth.... Sandy
seemed tireless. He even shook his head when Ken motioned
toward the cabin, indicating that he could keep
the pump going alone if Sandy wanted to go inside for
a moment.</p>

<p class='c015'>Back and forth ... back and forth....</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken fastened his eyes on the stream of water that
was pouring from the outlet. It seemed extremely small
compared to the enormous amount of water that must
be in the bilge.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How fast?” he asked Sandy, jerking his head toward
the outlet.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy understood his query. “Two quarts a stroke.”</p>

<p class='c015'>For a moment Ken thought he must be fooling. Only
two quarts a stroke! He had already figured that they
were pumping at about the rate of one stroke a second.
Now he tried to compute the results of their labors.
Two quarts a second—thirty gallons a minute.</p>

<p class='c015'>It wasn’t enough! It couldn’t be! Every time a wave
washed over the bulwarks it probably dumped several
hundred gallons of water into the hold—more than
they could pump out in ten long minutes of back-breaking
work. And the waves came far oftener than
once in every ten minutes. It was a losing battle.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>“What’s the use?” Ken shouted at Sandy, looking
down at their steadily moving hands.</p>

<p class='c015'>Again Sandy understood. “We’re buying time. Can’t
keep her afloat forever, but maybe something will happen.
Ship might sight us. Or the storm might die down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>His body sagged slightly. The effort of speech,
against the wind and on top of his weariness, had been
too much.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken tried to smile, and could feel the caking of salt
on his cheeks crack when his muscles moved.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure,” he shouted. “Something’s bound to happen.
Go inside and rest a minute.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy looked questioningly at the pump.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll keep her going,” Ken assured him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy nodded. Then his figure disappeared around
the corner of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken made himself keep an even pace. His impulse
was to drive his muscles with every bit of strength he
could muster—to quicken the rate of the strokes. But
he knew he couldn’t maintain a faster speed for more
than a moment, and that the effort would leave him
completely exhausted.</p>

<p class='c015'>Back and forth ... back and forth.... The
rhythm never broke except when a big wave came over
the bulwarks and Ken had to put all his energies into
hanging onto the handle to prevent himself from being
swept off his feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>Back and forth ... back and forth....</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly he was aware that Sandy had been gone a
long time.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>Ken felt panic seize him by the throat. If Sandy was
lying unconscious in the cabin, too weak to get up—if
he had been washed overboard—!</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken let go the pump handle and turned toward the
rear of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sandy! Sandy!” he called desperately into the wind.</p>

<p class='c015'>And in that moment Sandy appeared at the corner
of the cabin. With him was Cal, looking pale and obviously
terror-stricken.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy’s haggard face wore a grim smile. “New recruit!”
he shouted. He shoved Cal forward, ordered
him with a gesture to seize the pump handle.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Sandy leaned close to Ken’s ear. “Go inside for
a rest. We’ll take turns working with him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was still staring, stupefied. “But—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t worry,” Sandy told him. “He knows we’ll go
down if he doesn’t lend a hand. He’s scared stiff.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He looked at Cal, who seemed to be gazing at the
pump as if he’d never seen it before.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Work!” Sandy yelled. “You—”</p>

<p class='c015'>None of them had noticed the big wave coming.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken grabbed for the pump and ducked as the sweeping
torrent landed.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the water shot Cal’s feet out from under him and
threw his big helpless body toward the bulwark. Sandy
grabbed him just before he went over. When the wave
subsided he shoved Cal erect again.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now pump!” he yelled. “And hang on the next time
a wave comes over!” Then he seized the handle himself
and nodded to Ken to take a breather inside.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken moved toward the cabin door, still feeling dazed.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>Inside, out of the wind and the cold, he dropped onto
the lower bunk for a few minutes until his thudding
heart slowed to normal again.</p>

<p class='c015'>He had been startled when he saw Cal come out on
deck with Sandy, but now—as he thought it over—he
realized that Cal’s strength could be an asset instead of
something to dread. Now that he and Sandy both were
free of their bonds they could take care of Cal if it
became necessary. In the meantime, Cal could give valuable
service at the pump, spelling the boys one at a
time. Sandy had pointed out that they were buying
time. Cal could help them to buy a little more of it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken looked at his watch. It was only half past nine!
He felt as if days had gone by since Sandy and he first
staggered out onto the deck to try to re-start the pumping
engine.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly he realized that the fire in the stove had
died down—that the cabin was not as warm as it had
been. He was beginning to shiver as his sweat- and sea-drenched
clothes congealed. He struggled up from the
bunk, shook the fire, and poured on more coal.</p>

<p class='c015'>Coffee, he thought—that’s what we need. He found
the coffeepot in a corner under the cupboards, filled it,
and set it on the stove.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then he dived back toward the corner again. He had
belatedly become aware of an object that he had seen
there—a two-burner gasoline stove, apparently for use
in the summer when the coal stove would not be kept
going.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken picked the small compact mechanism up and
shook it. Its tank gurgled. There was gasoline inside!
Not much—but perhaps a gallon. Hugging the stove to
his chest he made his way outside to the pump.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>“Gas!” he shouted to Sandy.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy needed no further explanation. His cracked
lips split wide in a grin.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Keep pumping!” he ordered Cal. And then, taking
the stove from Ken, he led the way to the engine house.</p>

<p class='c015'>Carefully, as if they were pouring molten gold, they
emptied the liquid from the stove’s gas tank into the
tank of the engine. Then Sandy wrapped starting
rope around the pulley.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here goes!” The engine spun under Sandy’s pull, but
it didn’t quite catch. Sandy wrapped the rope around
the pulley again. He hunched his shoulders forward
and threw his full weight against the line.</p>

<p class='c015'>The engine coughed—sputtered—spit. It died momentarily,
and then it started again. The gears began
to move the rocker arm that worked the twin pistons.
Water spurted out of the pump’s big outlet pipe!</p>

<p class='c015'>“She’s going!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy closed the flap of the engine house. He got it
shut just before another wave struck them. They came
up gasping when it had subsided. The engine hadn’t
faltered.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken shouted against Sandy’s ear. “How long will she
run on a gallon?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy shrugged. “Maybe an hour. Better keep the
hand pump going too.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken nodded. Somehow he felt the worst was over.
They were going to survive after all, now that the big
pump was in operation. And suddenly a lot of questions—questions
he’d had no time to consider in his fear for
their lives—began to push their way forward from the
back of his mind.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>“Will Cal keep pumping if we leave him a minute
longer?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy looked puzzled but he nodded. “I think so.
He’s afraid we’re going down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then come inside a minute.” He took Sandy’s arm
and pulled him toward the cabin.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What’s the idea?” Sandy asked, when they had
closed the door. “We can’t let him go it alone too long.
He’ll tire and slow down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“This barge is a part of the counterfeiting organization,”
Ken said. “What do they use it for?” He jerked
open the two cupboards they had not yet explored.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you crazy?” Sandy demanded. “With luck we
may keep this thing afloat for a couple of hours—or less—if
we pump our fool heads off. Why’d you bring me
inside here to listen to riddles?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken was tossing clothes and various oddments out
into the middle of the floor. He answered without ceasing
his search. “Barges are handy for getting rid of
bodies. We know that’s why we were brought aboard.
They’re good for any illegal job that has to be done
privately. Why wouldn’t they be a good place for
printing counterfeit money?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here?” Sandy’s jaw dropped. “Where are you expecting
to find the printing press? In the coffeepot?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken, peering under the bunks, muttered, “Nothing
but a couple of life belts.” He turned and began to
scan the rough surface of the floor.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look,” Sandy began impatiently, “if you can’t—”</p>

<p class='c015'>He broke off as Ken shoved his nose close to the floor,
studying one particular plank. Without looking up he
reached onto the table for a fork from the cutlery box.
He jammed its tines into the crack alongside the plank
and pressed down on the handle. The plank lifted.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>Ken pulled it upward and it rose easily—a length of
ten-inch-wide board. He whistled softly.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy dropped onto his knees beside him. Together
they peered into the cavity that had been exposed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Printing ink,” Ken said, lifting out one of the several
bottles visible. “Green.” He checked another. “And
black.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy had his hand beneath the floor too, his anger
with Ken lost in curiosity. “A portable printing press!”
he breathed. “Dismantled—but you can see that’s what
it is!” He looked over at Ken, his eyes round. “I humbly
apologize for—”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken had lifted something else out of the cache.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy gasped.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mom’s jewel box!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“A duplicate of Mom’s box,” Ken corrected.</p>

<p class='c015'>With shaking hands he lifted the lid. The box was
empty. But the lead lining in the bottom lay on a slant
out of its proper place. Ken inserted the fork under
one corner and pulled.</p>

<p class='c015'>The lining lifted, revealing a half-inch of space beneath
it. Ken took out the object that had been concealed
in that shallow secret compartment. It was flat,
almost the same size as the box, and wrapped in flannel.</p>

<p class='c015'>He unwound the cloth.</p>

<p class='c015'>Neither of them said anything for a long moment.
They were looking at the three steel engravings required
to print a ten-dollar bill.</p>

    <div>OUT OF THE SKY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Sandy reached out to touch them as if he didn’t trust
the evidence of his eyes. “The one for the back. And
the two for the face—one for green ink, one for black.”
He shook his head amazedly. “And they were in that
box!” He felt the lead lining. “It’s as thin as paper,” he
said. “They must have made it that way to compensate
for the weight of the plates—to make both boxes weigh
about the same.” He looked up at Ken. “But they didn’t
quite do it—they were a few ounces out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dad brought the plates past customs not knowing
what he was doing.” Ken spoke slowly, piecing together
fragments of information. “They never thought
we’d find out—they never thought anybody would find
out.” He was rewrapping the plates and putting them
back into the box.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy got to his feet quickly. “And maybe nobody
ever will, if we don’t get ourselves out of this mess.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken lifted up the mattress on the lower bunk and
shoved the box under it out of sight. “We’ll need that
evidence,” he said, “and we don’t want Cal to throw it
overboard or something.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>Sandy dropped the plank back in place. “Let’s go,”
he said. “We’ll have to spell him for a while.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The bargeman was still working away at the pump,
but his strokes were slower now and he was panting
with near exhaustion. He made way for the boys and
leaned up against the cabin, clutching at it to maintain
his balance as the barge heaved and swung.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Stay there,” Sandy ordered, “where we can keep an
eye on you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Once again the seconds began to keep pace with the
pump handle and the stream of water spurted out of
the outlet pipe. Back on the deck the gasoline engine
throbbed reassuringly, its pump cascading a flood of
water over the side.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ten minutes passed by—then ten more. Ken was
breathing heavily, his arms like lead once more.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Drop out,” Sandy ordered. “Let him take over.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What about you?” Ken shifted to a position against
the wall and let the bargeman take hold of the pump
handle.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You spell me in ten minutes.” Sandy’s jaw was
clenched grimly as he moved his powerful arms back
and forth.</p>

<p class='c015'>The engine coughed and died.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Needs gas!” Cal let go of the pump handle.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Keep pumping,” Sandy said. “There is no more gas.
Whatever pumping is going to be done on this barge—we’re
going to do it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal looked at the water issuing from the outlet.
“We’ll never make it.” His voice was thin with fear.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>A wave washed over them and drowned out the rest
of his words.</p>

<p class='c015'>When they were free of water again Sandy went
back to work. “Save your breath,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ten minutes later Ken replaced Sandy at the pump
and the exhausted redhead got what rest he could by
slumping against the cabin wall. Ten minutes after that
he took Cal’s place.</p>

<p class='c015'>Round and round they went, fighting desperately
against time, trying to match their puny strength
against the ponderous walls of water that rolled down
on them and swept over the bulwark.</p>

<p class='c015'>By eleven o’clock it was plain that they had been
losing ground rapidly. The barge was growing more
sluggish with each passing wave. Her portside was
noticeably down—it was becoming even more difficult
to maintain a footing on the slippery, sharply sloping
deck.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken hung on to the pump handle as water washed
over the side. “How long?” he asked through clenched
teeth.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cal sputtered and coughed as the water receded. He
pointed a shaking finger to the cargo. “She’s shifting!”
he gasped. “We’ll turn over!” Panic drove him to the
bulwark. He poised there ready to jump.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy grabbed him and pulled him back. “Don’t be
a fool! You wouldn’t last out there a minute.” He held
on to the man while he turned his head to shout to
Ken. “Go on inside and bring out the life belts—and a
length of line.” He thrust Cal toward the pump handle.
“Get moving. She’s not going quite yet.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>Ken was gone almost ten minutes. When he returned,
sliding along the tilted deck in a moment of comparative
quiet between two waves, he carried two life belts
and a coil of half-inch line. He had already fastened a
life belt around himself.</p>

<p class='c015'>He handed a life belt to Sandy and took over the
pump while the redhead worked his way into the canvas
jacket. “Had to pick up something,” Ken said. He
poked at his life belt. “Got it fastened under here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy took over Cal’s place. “Get into the jacket,”
he ordered.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hang on!” Ken cried. “A big one coming!”</p>

<p class='c015'>The barge took long, agonizing seconds to rise from
under the weight of water. Over the noise of the wind
they could hear the rattle of stones as still more of the
cargo slipped toward the portside.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy looked forward anxiously. He stopped pumping
and swiftly tied the three of them together with the
line, leaving twenty feet of slack between them.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look!” Ken cried. “Blue sky!”</p>

<p class='c015'>High overhead a small patch had appeared in the
heavy overcast. As they watched, the wind spread the
clouds further and further apart and the patch of sky
grew larger.</p>

<p class='c015'>“One patch of blue sky doesn’t mean the sea will
calm down,” Sandy said grimly. “It may take hours
more for that to happen—days even.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As if to prove his words another comber swept over
them an instant later, to bury itself in the gravel and
add additional tons of water to the load the barge was
already carrying.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>More gravel cascaded down toward the bulwark.
The portside seemed a scant three feet above water
while the starboard side reared menacingly in the air.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy straightened up. “This isn’t accomplishing
much,” he said. “There’s no use kidding ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Abandon ship?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ll wait until the last possible moment,” Sandy
said. “We’ll climb up on the stone—way over on the
starboard side. When she goes down, she’ll roll to port.
That’s when we’ll jump to starboard. We have to clear
the barge when we hit the water or....”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was no need for him to finish the sentence. In
silence, with Sandy in the lead, they climbed up onto
the pile of stone and made their way to the top.</p>

<p class='c015'>Overhead the sky was clearing rapidly. The sun had
found a way through the last of the scudding gray
clouds. Even the wind was easing slightly. But the
waves were as high as they had ever been. From their
new vantage point the mammoth walls of onrushing
water seemed even larger.</p>

<p class='c015'>Huddled on the rough stone, they watched the barge
tilt more and more as the minutes passed. The cold got
at them now that they were no longer straining at the
pump handle. Their hands were numb, their lips blue.
Only tightly clenched jaws could keep their teeth from
chattering.</p>

<p class='c015'>The boys sat close together; Cal a few feet distant.
There was no conversation—there seemed to be nothing
to say.</p>

<p class='c015'>More stone slid down, carrying them toward the
portside. They clawed their way back up. Cal got to
his feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Get down!” Sandy shouted. “Nobody jumps until I
give the word. Then we all jump together.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>“She’s going over!” Cal swayed on unsteady feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy hauled on the line until he had brought the
terrified man down to his knees. “Don’t—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sandy!” Ken’s voice rang out above the noise of the
wind and the waves. “Do you hear it? A plane!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where!” Sandy’s voice cracked in the middle of the
word and his head jerked upward.</p>

<p class='c015'>Frantically they scanned the clear sky.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There!” Ken shouted finally. Instinctively he began
to wave his arms wildly in the air. “They’ll see us, won’t
they? And send the Coast Guard?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We have to signal them—we need something big.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Forgetting the rope that tied them together, Sandy
lunged down the pile of stone toward the cabin. Ken
and Cal were pulled down with him as he hurled himself
around the corner of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c015'>Before they could get to their feet Sandy was back,
carrying a blanket from one of the bunks. He scrambled
up the pile of stone, hauling impatiently at the line and
waving the blanket even before Ken and Cal could
reach him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It looks like it’s coming closer!” Ken shouted.</p>

<p class='c015'>The air-borne craft in the sky was dropping rapidly
now. Blinking their eyes against the glare of the sun,
they could see that it was a helicopter—a bare thousand
feet above the barge.</p>

<p class='c015'>Approaching from windward, the helicopter continued
to lose altitude as it swung in a circling maneuver
until it was directly over the barge. Then it began
to descend in a straight line like an elevator in an invisible
shaft. When the machine was a scant thirty feet
above their heads a door in the underbelly opened and
something fell seaward to land on the pile of stone a
few feet from where they stood.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>“It’s a ladder!” Ken shouted. “A rope ladder! Come
on!”</p>

<p class='c015'>The ladder was swinging back and forth in the wind.
Sandy made a grab for it and caught at the twisting
rope. The helicopter continued to drop until it hovered
only fifteen feet above them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken looked upward. His father’s face was peering
down at him from the aircraft.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dad!” Ken began to laugh, almost hysterical with
relief now that their long ordeal was over. “Don’t
bother to come aboard,” he shouted. “We were just
leaving, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Beside him, one arm thrust between the ladder rungs,
the other around Ken’s shoulders, Sandy was laughing
too.</p>

    <div>FRONT-PAGE NEWS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Six hours later, in Richard Holt’s apartment, Ken and
Sandy looked up at the sound of a key in the lock.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s Dad!” Ken said. “Now we’ll get the rest of the
story.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy eyed the tall paper bag that Ken’s father carried
in each arm. “Now we’ll get some food,” he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Richard Holt smiled as he set the bags on a low
table. “Help yourselves. There’s a hot roasted chicken
in there, from the rotisserie, and half the contents of
Max’s delicatessen. It occurred to me you might have
an appetite by now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ve been drinking hot coffee ever since we got
here,” Ken told him, opening up one bag, “and we
finally got warmed up. But coffee isn’t very filling.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sandy had already found the chicken, had dashed to
the kitchen for a knife, and was hacking it up in sizable
chunks.</p>

<p class='c015'>The correspondent pulled a newspaper out of his
overcoat pocket as he took the coat off. “Thought you
might want this too.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>“Hey, look!” Ken said, around a mouthful. “Photos by
Allen—two of them! And on the front page.”</p>

<p class='c015'>With an unconvincing air of boredom Sandy bent
over to see the pictures. One was a highly foreshortened
view of Barrack, Grace, and Cal seated around the
paper-littered table in the back room of the Tobacco
Mart. The other was a dramatic shot—also made from
above—of the stone-laden barge, her port gunwale already
under water, slipping sideways beneath the
waves.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not bad,” Sandy muttered. “That camera sure is
great. Sorry there wasn’t better light for the table shot,
though.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken grunted. “And I suppose you wish the helicopter
had taken a nose dive into the sea, so you could have
caught a better angle on the barge.” He shook his head.
“Nobody but you would even have thought of a camera
two seconds after being rescued from a briny grave.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Listen to who’s talking!” Sandy said indignantly.
“We weren’t in that windmill a minute before Ken was
telling you to radio to New York to have the T-men
close in on the Tobacco Mart.” He broke off, grinning.
“Now there’s a nice by-line. ‘By Richard and Ken
Holt.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh. I hadn’t even noticed it.” Ken glanced rapidly
at the story and then looked up at his father. “You
shouldn’t have let them put my name on it, Dad. You
wrote it, and put in all that stuff about the foreign
angle. I didn’t contribute anything but a couple of
guesses.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>“And the trail that led the Treasury men to a mighty
slick counterfeiting ring,” his father pointed out. “Besides,
your guesses were all pretty accurate. You were
right about everything. The plates were sold to Grace
and his gang by a European outfit for whom things
were getting a little too hot—the same outfit I was
talking about that day in the <i>Advance</i> office. They were
palmed off on me, in the iron box, so they’d be brought
through customs by a trustworthy character.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Richard Holt grinned. “And then,” he went on, “a
carefully prepared duplicate was substituted for the
box I’d brought. Grace has admitted he finally managed
the exchange—after two false tries, here and in Brentwood—at
Sam Morris’s store. Despite the fact,” he
added, “that his little arson trick was almost a fiasco.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken’s father watched the boys eating for a moment.
“You were also right,” he went on, “about the Tobacco
Mart being the distribution center, under Grace’s direction.
Barrack supplied paper and ink, through his printing
connections. And Cal was the printer, working on
the barge, just as you suspected. In fact, it was a well-planned
operation—until you two happened along.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Ken took one more glance at the by-line over the
front-page story headlined: TREASURY AGENTS
NAB COUNTERFEITERS. It gave him a good feeling
to see his own name and the name of his famous father
written together that way.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then he looked up. “Well, there are still some things
I’m guessing about,” he said. “That Treasury man asked
questions faster than anybody I ever met—but he
wasn’t very interested in answering any. I still don’t
know how the trail of bills actually put them on the
track. It seemed such a long chance when we tried it.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>“It was a long chance,” his father agreed. “But it
worked. Two New York banks had people waiting on
their doorsteps when they opened up this morning—people
who had found half a ten-dollar bill and who
wanted to know if they were entitled to exchange it for
a good one. Half an hour later two more had turned up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The bills were immediately recognized as phonies—good
as they were,” he went on, “and Treasury agents
were notified. They got in touch with me immediately,
in Washington, when they found my name scribbled
on the bills. Of course it was the one you left in the
truck that actually gave us the tip on where to look for
you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You left one in the truck?” Sandy sounded surprised.
“I didn’t know that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I didn’t get a chance to tell you,” Ken said. “I figured
that Cal borrowed the truck from some innocent man—someone
not in the gang. So I thought that if I left one
bill in the truck the owner might possibly find it. It
seemed the best chance we had to bring attention to
Cal and the barge in the shortest possible time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>His father nodded. “The truck owner was the third
man to turn up with half a bill. He’d found it when he
started to load fish this morning. And when the Treasury
people asked him where he’d found it and how it
got there, he said it must have been left by the man
who borrowed the truck last night. The T-men located
the spot where Cal’s barge was supposed to be tied up
and learned that it had been towed out at four this
morning, heading for Baltimore.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>Sandy sighed comfortably and put down a bare
chicken leg from which all the meat had been eaten.
“That’s when we figured we were really lost—when the
barge moved out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You shouldn’t underestimate the Treasury Department—or
the Coast Guard,” Richard Holt said. “It was
the Coast Guard that supplied the helicopter in record
time, got us on our way, and radioed the tug to find
your position.” He reached over and absent-mindedly
picked up a chicken wing and began to nibble at it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Speaking of underestimating,” he went on, “it looks
as though we underestimated you two. You told me in
the helicopter that Lausch said Mom’s box was both
old and not very valuable. What prompted you to continue
your prowling?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Neither of them answered him immediately. Ken was
suddenly very busy helping himself to potato salad
from a paper container.</p>

<p class='c015'>“He was worried about you,” Sandy said finally. “Because
of Barrack knowing your address here, when all
we’d told his landlady was the unlisted phone number.
And since your door had been found open—as if somebody
might have broken in—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I see,” Richard Holt said slowly. “I worry about you
sometimes, when I’m half the world away. It never
occurred to me that you’re far more likely to get yourself
into trouble when I’m at home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Dad!” Ken protested. “We don’t make a habit
of this—honest! No matter what Bert says, we don’t go
around looking for trouble. But I just had a hunch....”</p>

<p class='c015'>He let his voice trail away when he saw the twinkle
in Richard Holt’s eye.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>“Of course not,” his father said. “You don’t make a
habit of it. Things just happen to you.” He leaned back
in his chair. “Tell me, Sandy and Ken, do you suppose
there’s any way you could <i>prevent</i> things from happening?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll see,” Sandy assured him. “We’re planning to
work out some kind of system for that—immediately.
Aren’t we, Ken?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Absolutely,” Ken agreed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good,” Richard Holt said. “Very good indeed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But he would have sounded less relieved if he had
known of events that were taking place even as he
spoke—events that would soon enmesh the boys in the
hazardous adventure destined to become known as
<i>The Clue of the Phantom Car</i>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
